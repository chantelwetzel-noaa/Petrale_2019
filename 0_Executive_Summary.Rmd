#Executive Summary{-}

##Stock{-}
This assessment reports the status of the `r spp` (\emph{`r spp.sci`})  off the U.S. coast of California, Oregon, and Washington using data through `r Dat_end_mod1`.  While `r spp` are modeled as a single stock, the spatial aspects of the coast-wide population are addressed through geographic separation of data sources/fleets where possible. There is currently no genetic evidence suggesting distinct biological stocks of `r spp` off the U.S. coast. The limited tagging data available to describe adult movement suggests that `r spp` may have some homing ability for deep water spawning sites but also have the ability to move long distances between spawning sites, inter-spawning season, as well as seasonally.


##Landings{-}
While records do not exist, the earliest catches of `r spp` are reported in `r Dat_start_mod1` in California and 1884 in Oregon. In this assessment, fishery removals have been divided among 4 fleets: 1) Winter North trawl, 2) Summer North trawl, 3) Winter South trawl, and 4) Summer South trawl. Landings for the North fleet are defined as fish landed in Washington and Oregon ports. Landings for the South fleet are defined as fish landed in California ports. Recent annual catches between 1981-2018 range between `r min(round(Tot.catch.df[Tot.catch.df[,1] >= 1981 & Tot.catch.df[,1] <= 2018,2],0))` and `r max(round(Tot.catch.df[Tot.catch.df[,1] >= 1981 & Tot.catch.df[,1] <= 2018,2],0))` mt per year and the most recent year landings are shown in Table \ref{tab:Exec_catch}. The landings are summarized into winter and summer fleets where winter is defined as November to February and summer running from March to October. `r spp.up` are caught nearly exclusively by trawl fleets; non-trawl gears contribute only a small fraction of the catches across all years. 

From the inception of the fishery through the war years, the vast majority of catches occurred between March and October (the summer fishery), when the stock is dispersed over the continental shelf. The post-World War II period witnessed a steady decline in the amount and proportion of annual catches occurring during the summer months (March-October). Conversely, `r spp` catch during the winter season (November-February), when the fishery targets spawning aggregations, has exhibited a steadily increasing trend since the 1940s. From the mid-1980s through the early 2000s, catches during the winter months were roughly equivalent to or exceeded catches throughout the remainder of the year, whereas during the past 10 years, the relative catches during the winter and summer have been more variable across years (Table \ref{tab:Exec_catch}). `r spp.up` are a desirable market species and discarding has historically been low.

##Data and Assessment{-}
This an update assessment for `r spp`, which was last assessed in 2013 and updated in 2015.  This update assessment was conducted using the length- and age-structured modeling software Stock Synthesis (version 3.30.13).  The coastwide population was modeled allowing separate growth and mortality parameters for each sex (a two-sex model)  with the fishing year beginning on November 1 and ending on October 31.  The  fisheries are structured seasonally based on winter (November to February) and summer (March to October) fishing seasons due to the development and growth of the wintertime fishery, which began in the 1950s. In recent decades, wintertime catches have often exceed summertime catches. The fisheries are modeled as the Winter North and Summer North fleets, where the North includes both Washington and Oregon, and Southern Winter and Southern Summer encompasses California fisheries. 

The model includes fishery data in the form of catches, discard rates and average weights, length- and age-frequency data, as well as standardized winter fishery catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE). Biological data are derived from both port and on-board observer sampling programs. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) `r full.tri ` early (1980, 1983, 1986, 1989, 1992) and late period (1995, 1998, 2001, and 2004) and the `r nwfsc` (2003-2018) relative biomass indices and biological sampling provide fishery independent information on relative trend and demographics of the `r spp` stock.

##Updated Data{-}
The base assessment model structure is consistent with the 2013 assessment and the 2015 update, except as noted here. Modifications from the previous assessment model include:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Commercial catches (2015-2018 added);
  \item Commercial length and age data (all years reprocessed, 2015-2018 added);
  \item Observed discard rates, average weights, and lengths (2002-2017 reprocessed, 2014-2017 added); 
  \item `r full.tri` early and late indices of abundance and length composition data (1980-2004 reprocessed); 
  \item `r nwfsc` index of abundance, length and age composition data (2003-2018 reprocessed, 2015-2018 added);
  \item Model tuning to re-weight data using the McAllister and Iannelli approach (same approach applied in the 2013 assessment);
  \item Length-weight relationship parameters estimated outside of the stock assessment model from the `r nwfsc` data up to 2018 and input as fixed values;
  \item The natural mortality prior for female and male fish was updated; and,
  \item Model fitting using latest version of Stock Synthesis (SS v.3.30.13). 
\end{enumerate}


##Stock Biomass{-}
`r spp.up` were lightly exploited during the early 1900s, but by the 1950s, the fishery was well developed with the stock showing declines in biomass and catches (Figures \ref{fig:Exec_catch1} and \ref{fig:Spawnbio_all}). The rate of decline in spawning biomass accelerated through the 1970s reaching minimums generally around or below 10% of the unexploited levels during the 1980s through the early 2000s (Figure \ref{fig:RelDeplete_all}). The `r spp` spawning stock biomass is estimated to have increased in recent years due to reduced catches during rebuilding and in response to above average recruitment in 2006, 2007, and 2008. The `r LastYR` estimated spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass is above the target of 25% of unfished spawning biomass, at `r Depl_mod1` ($\sim$ 95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ `r Depl_mod1_CI`) (Table \ref{tab:SpawningDeplete_mod1}). The standard deviation of the log of the spawning biomass in `r LastYR` is `r round(mod1$Pstar_sigma,2)`.

##Recruitment{-}

Annual recruitment was treated as stochastic and estimated as annual deviations from log-mean recruitment, where mean recruitment is the fitted Beverton-Holt stock recruitment curve. The time-series of estimated recruitments shows a relationship with the decline in spawning biomass, punctuated by larger recruitments in 2006, 2007, and 2008 (Figure \ref{fig:Recruits_all}). However, recruitment in recent years (2013 - 2017) is estimated to be less than the expected mean recruitment indicating an absence of strong incoming recruitment (Table \ref{tab:Recruit_mod1}). 

The five largest estimated recruitments estimated within the model (in ascending order) occurred in `r recdev.highest[1]`, `r recdev.highest[2]`, `r recdev.highest[3]`, `r recdev.highest[4]`, and  `r recdev.highest[5]`. The four lowest recruitments estimated within the model (in ascending order) occurred in `r recdev.lowest[1]`, `r recdev.lowest[2]`, `r recdev.lowest[3]`, and `r recdev.lowest[4]`.

##Exploitation Status{-}
The relative spawning biomass of `r spp` was estimated to have dropped below the management target (25%) for the first time in `r first.yr.below.target`. The stock continued to decline and first fell below the minimum stock size threshold level of 12.5% in `r first.yr.below.thresh` (although, at the time the management target and thresholds were not set at the current values of 25% and 12.5%).  The relative spawning biomass reached its lowest level in `r low.ssb` at `r low.dep.value`, with the stock remaining around the threshold stock size until approximately 2010. In 2009 `r spp` was formally declared overfished. Fishing mortality rates sharply declined during the rebuilding period, relative to rates in previous years, which exceeded the target (Figure \ref{fig:SPR_all}). The 2015 update stock assessment estimated the stock to have rebuilt to the management target (25%) in 2014.  This update estimates that the relative spawning biomass exceeded 25% in `r yr.rebuilt` with harvest rates in the most recent years remaining under of the target rate (Table \ref{tab:SPR_Exploit_mod1} and Figures \ref{fig:SPR_all} and \ref{fig:Phase_all}).

##Ecosystem Considerations{-}
Ecosystem factors have not been explicitly modeled in this assessment, but there are several aspects of the California current ecosystem that may impact `r spp` population dynamics and warrant further research. Castillo [-@castillo_g.c._fluctuations_1992] and Castillo et al. [-@castillo_latitudinal_1995] suggest that density-independent survival of early life stages is low and show that offshore Ekman transportation of eggs and larvae may be an important source of variation in year-class strength in the Columbia INPFC area. The effects of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation on California current temperature and productivity [@mantua_pacific_1997] may also contribute to non-stationary recruitment dynamics for `r spp`. The prevalence of a strong late 1990s year-class for many West Coast groundfish species suggests that environmentally driven recruitment variation may be correlated among species with relatively diverse life history strategies. Although current research efforts along these lines are limited, a more explicit exploration of ecosystem processes may be possible in future `r spp` stock assessments if resources are available for such investigations.


##Reference Points{-}

This update stock assessment estimates that the spawning biomass of `r spp` is `r ifelse(Deplete_mod1[nrow(Deplete_mod1),2]-MT>0,"above","below")` the management target. Due to reduced landings and a series of above average recruitments (2006, 2007, and 2008), an increasing trend in spawning biomass was estimated in the base model from 2011 - 2017, with a decline in biomass in the most recent years (2018 and 2019) as the biomass of the above average cohorts declines. The estimated relative spawning biomass in `r LastYR` is `r Depl_mod1` ($\sim$ 95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ `r Depl_mod1_CI`), corresponding to an spawning biomass of `r paste(prettyNum(Spawn_mod1,big.mark=",", digits = 0), fecund_unit,sep=' ')` ($\sim$ 95% asymptotic interval: `r paste(prettyNum(Spawn_mod1_CI,big.mark=","), fecund_unit, sep=' ')`) (Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}).  Unfished age `r min_age` biomass was estimated to be `r prettyNum(formatC(Ref_pts_mod1[2,2],0),big.mark=",", drop0trailing = TRUE)` mt in the base model. 

The target spawning biomass based on the biomass target ($SB_{25\%}$) is `r paste(prettyNum(format(Ref_pts_mod1[7,2],0),big.mark=",", digits = 0), fecund_unit,sep=' ')`, with an equilibrium catch of `r prettyNum(format(Ref_pts_mod1[10,2],0),big.mark=",", digits = 0)` mt (Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}). Equilibrium yield at the proxy $F_{MSY}$ harvest rate corresponding to $SPR_{30\%}$ is `r prettyNum(format(Ref_pts_mod1[15,2],0),big.mark=",")` mt. Estimated MSY catch is at `r prettyNum(format(Ref_pts_mod1[20,2],0),big.mark=",", digits = 0)` spawning biomass of `r paste(prettyNum(format(Ref_pts_mod1[17,2],0),big.mark=",", digits = 0), fecund_unit,sep=' ')` (`r paste0(round(100 * as.numeric(Ref_pts_mod1[17,2])/as.numeric(Ref_pts_mod1[1,2]),1), "%")` relative spawning biomass).

##Management Performance{-}
The 2009 stock assessment estimated `r spp` to be at 11.6% of unfished spawning stock biomass. Based on the 2009 stock assessment, the 2010 coast-wide ACL was reduced to 1,200 mt to reflect the overfished status of the stock and the 2011 coast-wide overfishing limit (OFL) and ACL were set at 1,021 mt and 976 mt, respectively (Table \ref{tab:mnmgt_perform}). 

Recent coast-wide annual landings have not exceeded the ACL. The 2009, 2011, and 2013 full assessments estimated that `r spp` have been below the management target since the 1960s and below the overfished threshold between the early 1980s and 2009 with fishing mortality rates in excess of the current F-target for flatfish of $SPR_{30\%}$. The 2015 update assessment estimated that the stock had recovered with the relative spawning biomass exceeding the management target.

##Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties{-}
Parameter uncertainty is explicitly captured in the asymptotic confidence intervals reported throughout this assessment for key parameters and management quantities. These intervals reflect the uncertainty in the model fit to the data sources included in the assessment, but do not include uncertainty associated with alternative model configurations, weighting of data sources (a combination of input sample sizes and relative weighting of likelihood components), or fixed parameters.

There are a number of major uncertainties regarding model parameters that have been explored via sensitivity analysis. The most notable explorations involved the sensitivity of model estimates to:

\begin{enumerate}

\item The value of natural mortality by sex.	Natural mortality by sex and steepness are uncertain for `r spp`.  Currently, both natural mortality and steepness are estimated within the model and are negatively correlated.  This provides information regarding these parameters combined values, but there is large uncertainty regarding the value of each parameter individually.

\item New fecundity data for `r spp` supports a fecundity relationship that differs from the current assumption (fecundity equals body weights) in this update assessment. A sensitivity to the new data results in a less optomistic estimate of relative spawning biomass, declining to 35% from the base model 39%, when the new coast-wide fecundity relationship was included in the model. The new data supports differences in fecundity estimated between `r spp` observed in the north and south off the U.S. west coast.  However, some of the contrast in estimates between the northern and southern fish may be due to sample sizes differences. The next full assessment for `r spp` will want to explore methods of how best to include the new fedundity data. 

\item Additionally, a reconstructed historical Washington catch history has not been included in the `r spp` stock assessment.  Washington state is currently undergoing efforts to determine historical catches for `r spp` and the next stock assessment is likely to incorporate these new historical catch estimates. 

\end{enumerate}


##Decision Table{-}    
The forecast of stock abundance and yield was developed using the base model. The total catches in 2019 and 2020 are set equal to the ACL each year at `r paste(prettyNum(mod1$derived_quants["ForeCatch_2019", 2], big.mark=",", digits = 1),sep=' ')` mt and `r paste(prettyNum(mod1$derived_quants["ForeCatch_2020", 2], big.mark=",", digits = 1),sep=' ')` mt, respectively. The exploitation rate for 2021 and beyond is based upon an SPR of 30% and the 25:5 harvest control rule. The average exploitation rates, across recent years, by fleet as provided by the GMT were used to distribute catches during the forecast period. 

The catches during the forecasted period are projected from the base model, assuming a P* value of 0.45, start at `r paste(prettyNum(mod1$derived_quants["ForeCatch_2021", 2], big.mark=",", digits = 1),sep=' ')` mt in 2021 and decline to `r paste(prettyNum(mod1$derived_quants["ForeCatch_2030", 2], big.mark=",", digits = 1),sep=' ')` mt in 2030 as the stock declines towards the target spawning biomass (Table \ref{tab:OFL_projection}).  The projections assume full ABC removals.

Uncertainty in the forecasts is based upon the uncertainty around the `r LastYR` spawning biomass, $\sigma$ = `r round(mod1$Pstar_sigma,2)`. The low and high values for female natural mortality, $M$, were selected to result in a spawning biomass in `r LastYR` that was equal to the 12.5 and 87.5% quantiles of the normal distribution given the maximum likelihood estimate and the asymptotic uncertainty. The female natural mortality values the corresponded with the lower and upper quantiles were 0.105 yr^-1^ and 0.205 yr^-1^. 

There alternative catch streams were created for the decision table. The first option, ABC values were estimated using a category 1 $\sigma_y$ starting at 0.50 and increasing annually combined with a P$^*$ value of 0.45. The second option, uses the same category $\sigma_y$ values but applies a P$^*$ of 0.40. Both of the first two options assume full attainment of the catch values. The final option, employees a fixed catch approach where catches slowly step down during the 10-year projection period. 

Across the low and high states of nature and across alternative future harvest scenarios the relative spawning biomass (depletion) ranges between 0.193 - 0.384 by the end of the 10-year projection period (Table \ref{tab:Decision_table_mod1_es}).

##Research and Data Needs{-} 

Progress on a number of research topics and data issues would substantially improve the ability of this assessment to reliably and precisely model `r spp` population dynamics in the future:

\begin{enumerate}

\item In the past many assessments have derived historical catches independently. The states of California and Oregon have completed comprehensive historical catch reconstructions. At the time of this assessment, a comprehensive historical catch reconstruction is not available for Washington. Completion of a Washington catch reconstruction would provide the best possible estimated catch series that accounts for all the catch and better resolves historical catch uncertainty for flatfish as a group.

\item Due to limited data, new studies on the maturity at length or age for `r spp` would be beneficial.

\item Where possible, historical otolith samples aged using a combination of surface and break-and-burn methods should be re-aged using the break-and-burn method. Early surface read otoliths should also be re-aged using the break-and-burn method. Historical otoliths aged with a standard method will allow the further evaluation of the potential impacts of consistent under ageing using surface methods, changes in selectivity during early periods of time without any composition information, and potential changes in growth.

\item Studies on stock structure and movement of `r spp`, particularly with regard to the winter-summer spawning migration of `r spp` and the likely trans-boundary movement of `r spp` between U.S. and Canadian waters seasonally.

\item The extent of spatial variability on productivity processes such as growth, recruitment, and maturity is currently unknown and would benefit from further research.
