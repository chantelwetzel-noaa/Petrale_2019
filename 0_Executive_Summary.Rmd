#Executive Summary{-}

##Stock{-}
This assessment reports the status of the `r spp` (\emph{`r spp.sci`})  off  U.S. coast of California, Oregon, and Washington using data through `r Dat_end_mod1`.  While `r spp` are modeled as a single stock, the spatial aspects of the coast-wide population are addressed through geographic separation of data sources/fleets where possible. There is currently no genetic evidence suggesting distinct biological stocks of `r spp` off the U.S. coast. The limited tagging data available to describe adult movement suggests that `r spp` may have some homing ability for deep water spawning sites but also have the ability to move long distances between spawning sites, inter-spawning season, as well as seasonally.


##Landings{-}
While records do not exist, the earliest catches of `r spp` are reported in `r Dat_start_mod1` in California and 1884 in Oregon. In this assessment, fishery removals have been divided among 4 fleets: 1) winter North trawl, 2) summer North trawl, 3) winter South trawl, and 4) summer South trawl. Landings for the North fleet are defined as fish landed in Washington and Oregon ports. Landings for the South fleet are defined as fish landed in California ports. Recent annual catches between 1981-2018 range between `r min(round(Tot.catch.df[Tot.catch.df[,1] >= 1981 & Tot.catch.df[,1] <= 2018,2],0))` and `r max(round(Tot.catch.df[Tot.catch.df[,1] >= 1981 & Tot.catch.df[,1] <= 2018,2],0))` mt per year and the most recent year landing are shown in Table \ref{tab:Exec_catch}. `r spp.up` are caught nearly exclusively by trawl fleets; non-trawl gears contribute less than 3% of the catches. Based on the 2005 assessment, annual catch limits (ACLs) were reduced to 2499 mt for 2007-2008. Following the 2009 assessment ACLs were further reduced to a low of 976 mt for 2011 and have subsequently increased to a high value of 3,136 for 2017. From the inception of the fishery through the war years, the vast majority of catches occurred between March and October (the summer fishery), when the stock is dispersed over the continental shelf. The post-World War II period witnessed a steady decline in the amount and proportion of annual catches occurring during the summer months (March-October). Conversely, `r spp` catch during the winter season (November-February), when the fishery targets spawning aggregations, has exhibited a steadily increasing trend since the 1940s. From the mid-1980s through the early 2000s, catches during the winter months were roughly equivalent to or exceeded catches throughout the remainder of the year, whereas during the past 10 years the relative catches during the winter and summer have been more variable across years (\ref{tab:Exec_catch}). `r spp` are a desirable market species and discarding has historically been low.

##Data and Assessment{-}
This an update assessment for `r spp`, which was last assessed in 2013 and updated in 2015.  The update assessment was conducted using the length- and age-structured modeling software Stock Synthesis (version 3.30.13).  The coastwide population was modeled allowing separate growth and mortality parameters for each sex (a two-sex model)  with the fishing year beginning on November 1 and ending on October 31.  The  fisheries are structured seasonally based on winter (November to February) and summer (March to October) fishing seasons due to the development and growth of the wintertime fishery, which began in the 1950s. In recent decades wintertime catches have often exceed summertime catches. The fisheries modeled as the North Winter and North Summer, where the north includes both Washington and Oregon, and South Winter and South Summer encompasses California fisheries. 

The model includes catch, length- and age-frequency data from the trawl fleets as well as standardized winter fishery catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) indices. Biological data are derived from both port and on-board observer sampling programs. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) `r full.tri ` early (1980, 1983, 1986, 1989, 1992) and late period (1995, 1998, 2001, and 2004) and the `r nwfsc` (2003-2018) relative biomass indices and biological sampling provide fishery independent information on relative trend and demographics of the `r spp` stock.

##Updated Data{-}
The base stock assessment model structure is consistent with the 2013 assessment and the 2015 update, except as noted here. Modifications from the previous assessment model include:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Model fitting using latest version of Stock Synthesis (SS v.3.30.13). 

\item Added commercial fishery catch data (2015-2018).

\item Updated historical composition data from the commercial fishery (length and age data) and new data (2015 - 2018) expanded to trip and catch based on current best practices.

\item Updated discard rate, average weight, and discard length composition data (2014-2017).

\item `r nwfsc` index of abundance was calculated using VAST.

\item Updated `r nwfsc` length and age data (2015-2018) with all years data expanded to the tow and strata.

\item `r full.tri` early and late index of abundance were calculated using VAST.

\item Model tuning to re-weight data. 

\item Length-weight relationship parameters estimated outside of the stock assessment model from the `r nwfsc` data up to 2018 and input as fixed values.

\item Update the natural mortality prior for female and male fish.

\end{enumerate}


##Stock Biomass{-}
`r spp.up` were lightly exploited during the early 1900s, but by the 1950s the fishery was well developed and showing clear signs of depletion and declines in catches and biomass (Figures \ref{fig:Exec_catch1} and  \ref{fig:Spawnbio_all}). The rate of decline in spawning biomass accelerated through the 1930s-1970s reaching minimums generally around or below 10% of the unexploited levels during the 1980s through the early 2000s (Figure \ref{fig:RelDeplete_all}). The `r spp` spawning stock biomass is estimated to have increased in recent year due to reduced catches during rebuilding and in response to above average recruitment in 2006, 2007, and 2008. The `r LastYR` estimated spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass is above the target of 25% of unfished spawning biomass at `r Depl_mod1` ($\sim$ 95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ `r Depl_mod1_CI`).

##Recruitment{-}

Annual recruitment was treated as stochastic, and estimated as annual deviations from log-mean recruitment where mean recruitment is the fitted Beverton-Holt stock recruitment curve. The time-series of estimated recruitments shows a relationship with the decline in spawning biomass, punctuated by larger recruitments (Figure \ref{fig:Recruits_all}) in 2006, 2007, and 2008. The five largest estimated recruitment estimated with the model (in ascending order) occurred in `r recdev.highest[1]`, `r recdev.highest[2]`, `r recdev.highest[3]`, `r recdev.highest[4]`, and  `r recdev.highest[5]`. The four lowest recruitments estimated within the model (in ascending order) occurred in `r recdev.lowest[1]`, `r recdev.lowest[2]`, `r recdev.lowest[3]`, and `r recdev.lowest[4]`.

##Exploitation Status{-}
The relative spawning biomass of of `r spp` was estimated to have dropped below the management target (25%) for the first time in `r first.yr.below.target`. The stock continued to decline and first fell below the minimum stock size threshold level of 12.5% in `r first.yr.below.thresh`.  The relative spawning biomass remained around the threshold stock size until approximately 2010, with the stock reaching its lowest relative spawning biomass level in `r low.ssb` at `r low.dep.value`. In 2009 `r spp` was formally declared overfished. Fishing mortality rates sharply declined during the rebuilding period relative to previous year rates which exceeded the target (Figure \ref{fig:SPR_all}). After reduced harvests, the 2015 update stock assessment estimated the stock to have rebuilt to the management target (25%) in 2014.  This update estimates that the relative spawning biomass exceed 25% in `r yr.rebuilt` with harvest rates in the most recent years remaining just under of the target rate (Figure \ref{fig:SPR_all}).

##Ecosystem Considerations{-}
Ecosystem factors have not been explicitly modeled in this assessment, but there are several aspects of the California current ecosystem that may impact `r spp` population dynamics and warrant further research. Castillo [-@castillo_g.c._fluctuations_1992] and Castillo et al. [-@castillo_latitudinal_1995] suggest that density-independent survival of early life stages is low and show that offshore Ekman transportation of eggs and larvae may be an important source of variation in year-class strength in the Columbia INPFC area. The effects of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation on California current temperature and productivity [@mantua_pacific_1997] may also contribute to non-stationary recruitment dynamics for `r spp`. The prevalence of a strong late 1990s year-class for many West Coast groundfish species suggests that environmentally driven recruitment variation may be correlated among species with relatively diverse life history strategies. Although current research efforts along these lines are limited, a more explicit exploration of ecosystem processes may be possible in future `r spp` stock assessments if resources are available for such investigations.


##Reference Points{-}

This stock assessment estimates that the spawning biomass of `r spp` is `r ifelse(Deplete_mod1[nrow(Deplete_mod1),2]-MT>0,"above","below")` the management target. Due to reduced landings and the large 2008 year-class, an increasing trend in spawning biomass was estimated in the base model. The estimated depletion in `r LastYR` is `r Depl_mod1` ($\sim$ 95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ `r Depl_mod1_CI`), corresponding to an spawning biomass of `r paste(prettyNum(Spawn_mod1,big.mark=","), fecund_unit,sep=' ')` ($\sim$ 95% asymptotic interval: `r paste(prettyNum(Spawn_mod1_CI,big.mark=","), fecund_unit, sep=' ')`).  Unfished age `r min_age` biomass was estimated to be `r prettyNum(Ref_pts_mod1[2,2],big.mark=",")` mt in the base model. The target spawning biomass based on the biomass target ($SB_{25\%}$) is `r paste(prettyNum(format(Ref_pts_mod1[7,2],0),big.mark=","), fecund_unit,sep=' ')`, with an equilibrium catch of `r prettyNum(format(Ref_pts_mod1[10,2],0),big.mark=",")` mt. Equilibrium yield at the proxy $F_{MSY}$ harvest rate corresponding to $SPR_{30\%}$ is `r prettyNum(format(Ref_pts_mod1[15,2],0),big.mark=",")` mt. Estimated MSY catch is at a `r prettyNum(format(Ref_pts_mod1[20,2],0),big.mark=",")` spawning biomass of `r paste(prettyNum(format(Ref_pts_mod1[17,2],0),big.mark=","), fecund_unit,sep=' ')` (`r paste0(round(100 * as.numeric(Ref_pts_mod1[17,2])/as.numeric(Ref_pts_mod1[1,2]),1), "%")` depletion).

##Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties{-}
Parameter uncertainty is explicitly captured in the asymptotic confidence intervals reported throughout this assessment for key parameters and management quantities. These intervals reflect the uncertainty in the model fit to the data sources included in the assessment, but do not include uncertainty associated with alternative model configurations, weighting of data sources (a combination of input sample sizes and relative weighting of likelihood components), or fixed parameters.

There are a number of major uncertainties regarding model parameters that have been explored via sensitivity analysis. The most notable explorations involved the sensitivity of model estimates to:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Value of female natural mortality.

\item Sex ratio between female and male `r spp`.

\item Changes in estimated based on alternative data weighting approaches.

\end{enumerate}

Additionally, to date a reconstructed historical Washington catch history has not been included in the `r spp` stock assessment.  Washington state is currently undergoing efforts to determine historical catches.  

##Decision Table{-}    

Model uncertainty has been described by the estimated uncertainty within the base model and by the sensitivities to different model structure.

##Research and Data Needs{-} 

Progress on a number of research topics and data issues would substantially improve the ability of this assessment to reliably and precisely model `r spp` population dynamics in the future:

\begin{enumerate}

\item In the past many assessments have derived historical catches independently. The states of California and Oregon have completed comprehensive historical catch reconstructions. At the time of this assessment, a comprehensive historical catch reconstruction is not available for Washington. Completion of a Washington catch reconstruction would provide the best possible estimated catch series that accounts for all the catch and better resolves historical catch uncertainty for flatfish as a group.

\item Due to limited data, new studies on the maturity relationships for `r spp` would be beneficial.

\item Where possible, historical otolith samples aged using a combination of surface and break-and-burn methods should be re-aged using the break-and-burn method. Early surface read otoliths should also be re-aged using the break-and-burn method. Historical otoliths aged with a standard method will allow the further evaluation of the potential impacts of consistent under ageing using surface methods, changes in selectivity during early periods of time without any composition information, and potential changes in growth.

\item Studies on stock structure and movement of `r spp`, particularly with regard to the winter-summer spawning migration of `r spp` and the likely trans-boundary movement of `r spp` between U.S. and Canadian waters seasonally.

\item The extent of spatial variability on productivity processes such as growth, recruitment, and maturity is currently unknown and would benefit from further research.
