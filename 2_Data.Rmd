##Fishery-Independent Data

###NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey
Three sources of information are produced by this survey: an index of relative abundance, length-frequency distributions, and age-frequency distributions. Only years in which the `r nwfsc` included the continental shelf (55-183 m) are considered (2003-2018), since the highest percent of positive survey tows with `r spp` are found on the continental shelf.

The `r nwfsc` is based on a random-grid design; covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55 m to 1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011]. This design uses four industry chartered vessels per year, assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two 'passes' of the coast that are executed from north to south. Two vessels fish during each pass, which are conducted from late May to early October each year. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (~700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian border. 

The `r nwfsc` commonly encounters `r spp` along the U.S West Coast, except south of Point Conception (Figure \ref{fig:nw_map}). The catch-per-unit-effort estimated from the survey is roughly constant north of 38$^\circ$ (Figure \ref{fig:nw_cpue_lat}). The survey does fish shallower than 54 m and no `r spp` were caught deeper than 550 m. Figure \ref{fig:nw_cpue_depth} shows that the postie tows catch rate by depth peaks between 100-200 meters and declines as depth increases.

The data from the `r nwfsc` was analyzed using a spatio-temporal delta model implemented as an R package, VAST [@thorson_comparing_2017; @thorson_guidance_2019], which is publicly available online (https://github.com/James-Thorson/VAST). Spatial and spatio-temporal variation is specifically included in both encounter probability and positive catch rates, a logit-link for encounter probability and a log-link for positive catch rates. Vessel-year effects were included for each unique combination of vessel and year in the data to account for the random selection of commercial vessels used during sampling [@helser_generalized_2004; @thorson_accounting_2013]. Spatial variation was approximated using 250 knots, and the model used the bias-correction algorithm [@thorson_implementing_2016] in Template Model Builder [@kristensen_tmb:_2016]. Further details regarding model structure are available in the user manual (https://github.com/James-Thorson/VAST/blob/ master/examples/VAST user manual.pdf). The stratification is provided in Table \ref{tab:strata_nwfsc}.

The gamma distribution with random strata-year and vessel effects was chosen as the final model. The Q-Q plot does not show any departures from the assumed distribution (Figure \ref{fig:nw_qq}). The Pearson residuals for the encounter and catch rates for gamma distribution model are shown in Figures \ref{fig:nw_enc_rate} and \ref{fig:nw_catch_rate}. 

The estimated index of abundance is shown in Table \ref{tab:Index_Summary}. For contrast, the 2015 model estimated, the 2019 design based, and the 2019 VAST indices are shown in Figure \ref{fig:nw_index} and the spatial density by year estimated by VAST are shown in Figure \ref{fig:nw_density}.  The index for the `r nwfsc` shows an increase in the population between 2009 and 2014 and roughly stable through 2017, and decrease in the most recent year.

Length bins from 12 to 62 cm in 2 cm increments were used to summarize the length frequency of the survey catches in each year. Table \ref{tab:NWcombo_Lengths} shows the number of lengths taken by the survey. The first bin includes all observations less than 14 cm and the last bin includes all fish larger than 62 cm. The length frequency distributions for the `r nwfsc` from 2003-2018 generally show a strong cohort growing through 2005 and smaller fish entering the population beginning in 2007 rows with a large 2014 cohort entering the populations (Figure \ref{fig:nw_len_freq}). 

Age distributions included bins from age 1 to age 17, with the last bin including all fish of greater age. Table \ref{tab:NWcombo_Ages} shows the number of ages taken by the survey. The marginal `r nwfsc` age-compositions, which allow for easier viewing of strong cohorts, show the strong 1998 cohort ageing from 2003 to 2007, with younger fish appearing between 2008-2014 (Figure \ref{fig:nw_age_freq}). The exception to this is the female composition in 2005, where only one female fish was aged from the tow with the largest catch rate. The expansion of numbers to tow can greatly affect the marginal age distribution, but does not have as much effect on the conditional age-at-length data.

The input sample sizes for length and marginal age-composition data for all fishery-independent surveys were calculated based on the approach used in the 2013 full and 2015 update assessment as: 

\begin{centering}

$N = (0.138*(\sum_{}^{N} fish_{y} / \sum_{}^N tows_{y}) + 1)*\sum_{}^N tows_y$ 

\end{centering}

where fish is the number of `r spp` by year $y$ and the total number of tows by year.  The effective sample size of conditional-age-at-length data was set at the number of fish at each length by sex and by year. The conditional-age-at-length data were not expanded and were binned by according to length, age, sex, and year.

###AFSC/NWFSC West Coast Triennial Shelf Survey
The `r full.tri` (referred to as the `r tri` for short) was first conducted by the AFSC in 1977 and spanned the time-frame from 1977-2004. The survey's design and sampling methods are most recently described in Weinberg et al. [-@weinberg_2001_2002]. Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced transects from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated. The survey design has changed slightly over the period of time. In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid-summer through early fall: the 1977 survey was conducted from early July through late September; the surveys from 1980 through 1989 ran from mid-July to late September; the 1992 survey spanned from mid-July through early October; the 1995 survey was conducted from early June to late August; the 1998 survey ran from early June through early August; and the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted in May-July.

Haul depths ranged from 91-457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls shallower than 91 m. The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the West Coast south to $36.8^\circ$ N latitude and a depth range of 55-366 m. The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the southern range to $34.5^\circ$ N (near Point Conception). From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range 55-500 m and surveyed south to $34.5^\circ$ N. In the final year of the `r tri` series, 2004, the NWFSC's Fishery Resource and Monitoring division (FRAM) conducted the survey and followed very similar protocols as the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC).

Due to changes in survey timing, the `r tri` data have been split into independent early (1980-1992) and late (1995-2004) survey time series. The splitting of this time series was investigated during the 2009 STAR panel due to the changes in survey timing and the expected change in `r spp` catchability because of the stock's seasonal onshore-offshore migrations [@cook_petrale_2009]. For these reasons, as well as because the split improved fits to the split time series and made small changes to the estimation of the selectivity curves, the 2009 STAR panel supported the split.

The `r tri` commonly encounters `r spp` along the U.S West Coast (Figure \ref{fig:tri_map}). The catch-per-unit-effort estimated from the survey is roughly constant across the surveyed latitudes (Figure \ref{fig:tri_cpue_lat}). Additionally, `r spp` were captured across the survey depths between 55-500 m (Figure \ref{fig:tri_cpue_depth}).

The data from the `r spp` was analyzed using a spatio-temporal delta model implemented as an R package, VAST [@thorson_comparing_2017; @thorson_guidance_2019], described above in Section \ref{nwfsc-west-coast-groundfish-bottom-trawl-survey}. Spatial variation was approximated using 250 knots, and the model used the bias-correction algorithm [@thorson_implementing_2016] in Template Model Builder [@kristensen_tmb:_2016]. The index of abundance was estimated using VAST seperately for the early and late periods of the survey. The stratifications are provided in Tables \ref{tab:strata_tri_early} and \ref{tab:strata_tri_late}.

The gamma distribution with random strata-year and vessel effects was chosen as the final model for both the early and late time periods. The Q-Q plots do not show any departures from the assumed distribution (Figures \ref{fig:tri_early_qq} and \ref{fig:tri_late_qq}). The Pearson residuals for the encounter and catch rate for the early and late periods are shown in Figures \ref{fig:tri_early_enc_rate}, \ref{fig:tri_early_catch_rate}, \ref{fig:tri_late_enc_rate}, and \ref{fig:tri_late_catch_rate}.

The estimated index of abundance is shown in Table \ref{tab:Index_Summary}. For contrast, the 2015 model estimated, the 2019 design based, and the 2019 VAST indices are shown in Figure \ref{fig:tri_index} and the estimated density of `r spp` is show in Figures \ref{fig:tri_early_density} and \ref{fig:tri_late_density}. The index for the `r tri` across the early and late period shows an slight increase in the population between 1980 and 2001 with a spike in the final year of 2004.

Length bins from 12 to 62 cm in 2 cm increments were used to summarize the length frequency of the survey catches in each year. Table \ref{tab:Triennial_Lengths} shows the number of lengths taken by the survey. The first bin includes all observations less than 14 cm and the last bin includes all fish larger than 62 cm. The length frequency distributions for the `r tri` from 1980-2004 are shown in Figures \ref{fig:tri_early_len_freq} and \ref{fig:tri_late_len_freq}. 

There are no `r spp` age data from the `r tri`.  

The input sample sizes for length data were calculated using the same approach for the `r nwfsc` data described in Section \ref{nwfsc-west-coast-groundfish-bottom-trawl-survey}.

##Fishery-Dependent Data

###Commercial Fishery Landings

All landings for this update assessment were summarized by port of landing, where available, as well as for a northern fleet consisting of Washington and Oregon and a southern fleet consisting of California. Landings for Washington and Oregon are summed into a single northern fleet due to the fact that vessels commonly fish and land in each other's waters and ports. 

The PacFIN database (1981-2018 for California and Washington; 1987-2018 for Oregon) extracted June 26, 2019. Historical catches were not updated from the previous assessment in 2013. The 2013 assessment historical Washington catches were obtained from WDFW landings reconstruction for 1935, 1939 and 1949- 1969 (pers. comm. T. Tsou and G. Lippert) and the Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission (PMFC) Data Series for 1956-1980 [@pfmc_data_1979]. The 2013 assessment historical Oregon landings were obtained from reconstruction for 1932 to 1986 [@karnowski_historical_2014]. The 2013 assessment historical California landings used catch reconstruction data extending from 1931-1980 [@ralston_documentation_2010] and California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) Fish Bulletins for 1916-1930 landings [@heimann_pacific_1970] as reconstructed by Lai et al. [-@lai_stock_2005]. The California fishery began in 1876 but no landings data are available from 1876-1915. Therefore a linear interpolation between landings of 1 ton in 1876 and the landings recorded for 1916 are used to filling this period.

Landings for the fishing year, beginning on 1 November, are summarized by fleet in Table \ref{tab:Comm_Catch} and Figure \ref{fig:Catch}. The landings of `r spp` by gear types other than groundfish-trawl have been inconsequential, averaging less than 2.5% of the coast-wide landings. The non-trawl landings are included in the trawl landings. 


###Discards

Data on discards of `r spp` are available from two different data sources.  The earliest source is referred to as the Pikitch data and comes from a study organized by Ellen Pikitch that collected trawl discards from 1985-1987 [@pikitch_evaluation_1988].  The northern and southern boundaries of the study were $48^\circ 42^\prime$ N latitude and $42^\circ 60^\prime$ N latitude respectively, which is primarily within the Columbia INPFC area [@pikitch_evaluation_1988; @rogers_numerical_1992].  Participation in the study was voluntary and included vessels using bottom, midwater, and shrimp trawl gears.  Observers of normal fishing operations on commercial vessels collected the data, estimated the total weight of the catch by tow, and recorded the weight of species retained and discarded in the sample.  Results of the Pikitch data were obtained from John Wallace (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA) in the form of ratios of discard weight to retained weight of `r spp` and sex-specific length frequencies.  The Pikitch discard estimates were applied to both the summer and winter northern fisheries and are shown in Table \ref{tab:Discard}.   

The second source is from the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP).  This program is part of the NWFSC and has been recording discard observations since 2003. Table \ref{tab:Discard} shows the discard ratios (discarded/(discarded + retained)) of `r spp` from WCGOP.  Since 2011, when the trawl rationalization program was implemented, observer coverage rates increased to nearly 100% for all the limited entry trawl vessels in the program and discard rates declined compared to pre-2011 rates.  Discard rates were obtained for both the catch-share and the non-catch share sector for `r spp`.  A single discard rate was calculated by weighting discard rates based on the commercial landings by each sector.  Coefficient of variations were calculated for the non-catch shares sector and pre-catch share years by bootstrapping vessels within ports because the observer program randomly chooses vessels within ports to be observed. The discard rates from WCGOP are shown in Table \ref{tab:Discard}. 

Starting in 2015 a small number of vessels switched to electronic monitoring discards at sea (4, 7, and 8 vessels in 2015, 2016, and 2017 respectively) rather than a human observer and as of this update assessment only 3 years of data are available. Discarding rates at sea of `r spp` by these vessels were very low, near zero. This update assessment did not evaluate these data to estimate an electronic monitoring specific discard rate, but rather applied the discard ratio from the observed vessels in the WCGOP database.  Future assessments should evaluate this assumption in greater detail.

Discard mean body weight data were obtained from the WCGOP data and used in this update assessmet for each of the four fishing fleets.  The mean body weight of discarded fish from each fleet are shown in Figures \ref{fig:nw_bodywt} - \ref{fig:ss_bodywt}.  The summer fisheries, both north and south, had relatively large sample numbers which is reflected in a lower CV by year relative to the winter fisheries. 

Discard length composition data were obtained from the WCGOP data and used in this update assessment to estimate retention curves for each of the four fishing fleets.  The discard length data from each fleet are shown in Figures \ref{fig:north_lengths} and \ref{fig:south_lengths}.

The data, historical and current, provided by the WCGOP are updated annually based on the most recent standards of QA/QC methods. Hence, these data can have minor changes over time.  To ensure the data from the years since the last update assessment (2014-2018) were consistent with the earlier data, data from all years were replaced based to reflect the current standings of the WCGOP data.  

###Foreign Landings 
The impact of landings of `r spp` by foreign fishing fleets prior to the institution of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the U.S. West Coast is currently not quantified and remains an area for research.

###Historical Commercial Catch-Per-Unit Effort/Logbooks

Commercial logbook data for `r spp` was first used to construct CPUE indices of abundance in the 1999 assessment for Oregon fleets from 1987-1997 [@sampson_assessment_1999]. Since the first inclusion 1999, the commercial CPUE indices were extended and or updated based on management changes and new statistical methods through 2009. For additional information on the use of CPUE indices in the assessment of `r spp` please see the 2013 assessment [@haltuch_status_2013].

CPUE calculations for the Winter fishery on aggregations of `r spp` described in the 2013 assessment were retained for this assessment [@haltuch_status_2013] (Figures \ref{fig:north_cpue} and \ref{fig:south_cpue}). Two CPUE indices from 1987-2009 with catchability modeled as a power function are used in this update assessment, one for the north and south winter fisheries.

###Fishery Length and Age Data

The PacFIN BDS database contains data from Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW; 1966-present) and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW; 1955- present), but only 1986-present data from California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG). The CDFG data set for the years 1948-1992 was extracted and provided from CALCOM by Brenda Erwin (CDFG) in 2011. 

The historical Oregon data for `r spp` has change substantially since 2015.  The state has identified that all samples collected prior to 1987 were not collected according to the state's standardized sampling protocal that were included in PacFIN as random samples in error (pers. comm. Ali Whitman). These samples likely represent samples that were collected for special projects.  Oregon has removed some of these samples for `r spp` from PacFIN, but not all as of 2019. To remove the remaining non-standard samples, Oregon PacFIN data were filtered to remove all samples prior to 1987.  Although these samples were removed from the length and age composition data for this update assessment, future assessments should evaluate these data to determine if they can be included within the assessment through alternative means (e.g., external estimates of length-at-age). 

Commercial length-frequency distributions based on the fishing year were developed for each state for which observations were available. For each fleet, the raw observations (compiled from the PacFIN and CalCOM databases) were expanded to the sample level, to allow for any fish that were not measured, then to the trip level to account for the relative size of the landing from which the sample was obtained. The expanded length observations were then expanded by the landings in each state for the combined Washington and Oregon fleet. Age frequencies were computed in the same manner, except that age observations for Washington and Oregon were not combined due to aging error considerations. 

Length and age data collected from commercial landings for each fleet are summarized by the number of trips and fish sampled by year (Tables \ref{tab:Fishery_Lengths} and \ref{tab:Fishery_Ages}). Figures \ref{fig:north_lengths}, \ref{fig:south_lengths}, and \ref{fig:comm_ages} show plots of the commercial length and age composition data across time for each fishery fleet.

The calculation for input sample sizes for the commercial length and age data was done to be consistent with the 2015 update assessment. The input sample size for commercial lengths and ages were set equal to the number of trips by year for each fleet.

<!--********************BIOLOGICAL DATA*************************************-->

##Biological Data

###Natural Mortality
 
The instantaneous rate of natural mortality for a wild fish population is notoriously difficult to estimate. One accepted method is to examine the age distribution of an unexploited or lightly exploited stock. This method cannot readily be applied to `r spp` given the long history of exploitation off the U.S. West Coast. Ketchen and Forrester [-@ketchen_population_1966] estimated that the natural mortality coefficients were 0.18-0.26 yr^-1^ for males and 0.19-0.21 yr^-1^ for females based on a catch curve analysis of 1943-1945 Washington trawl data from Swiftsure Bank, off the southwest corner of Vancouver Island. However, `r spp` catches were relatively high during mid-1940s through the 1950s. Starr and Fargo [-@starr_petrale_2004] estimated the instantaneous rate of natural mortality ($M$) using Hoenig's method [@hoenig_empirical_1983] estimating $M$ values of 0.22 and 0.15 yr^-1^ were estimated given maximum ages of 20 and 30 years, respectively.   

An archived set of commercial samples, collected from Northern California between the late 1950s and early 1980s, recently found that multiple samples were aged between 20-31 years old, suggesting a similar range of $M$ values for U.S. West Coast `r spp`. U.S. stock assessments prior to 2009 and current British Columbia stock assessments assumed a value of $M$ = 0.2 yr^-1^ for both sexes. The 2013 stock assessment used a meta-analysis value produced the following normal prior distributions for females (mean = 0.151, sd = 0.16) and males (0.206, sd = 0.218) based on early research by Owen Hamel (pers. comm.) with maximum age for females and males of 32 and 29 years, respectively.

Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015] refined and published a method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating the $M$ rate to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior on $M$. In that same issue of *ICES Journal of Marine Science*, Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] provided an updated data set of estimates of $M$ and related life history parameters across a large number of fish species from which to develop an $M$ estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by recommending $M$ estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an updated Hoenig non-linear least squares estimator $M=4.899A^{-0.916}_{max}$. The approach of basing $M$ priors on maximum age alone was one that was already being used for West Coast rockfish assessments. However, in fitting the alternative model forms relating $M$ to $A_{\text{max}}$, Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] did not consistently apply their transformation. In particular, in real space, one would expect substantial heteroscedasticity in both the observation and process error associated with the observed relationship of $M$ to $A_{\text{max}}$. Therefore, it would be reasonable to fit all models under a log transformation. This was not done. Re-evaluating the data used in Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] by fitting the one-parameter $A_{\text{max}}$ model under a log-log transformation (such that the slope is forced to be -1 in the transformed space [@hamel_method_2015]), the point estimate for $M$ is:

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

The above is also the median of the prior. The prior is defined as a lognormal distribution with mean $ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})$ and SE = 0.438. 

The natural mortality prior was updated for this update assessment using the above approach. Maximum age was assumed to be 32 and 29 years for females and males, respectively, the same assumption applied in the 2013 assessment. Using the Hamel et al. approach above, the prior value for females in regular space is `r round(5.4/32, 3)` and for males is `r round(5.4/29, 3)`. 


###Maturation and Fecundity

`r spp.up` maturity-at-length information is generally sparse in space and time, has not been collected in a systematic fashion across time, is of varying quality, and does not always agree between studies. It is possible that maturity may have changed over time. However, it is not possible to assess this quantitatively owing to differences in when historical samples on which maturity ogives could be based were taken, and how maturity stage (visual vs. histological) was determined. The 2005 `r spp` assessment used the most recent study for the West Coast of the U.S. that was based on observations collected during 2002 from Oregon and Washington [@hannah_length_2002]. The 50% size-at-maturity was estimated at `r mod1$MGparmAdj[1,"Mat50%_Fem_GP_1"]` cm with maturity asymptoting to 1.0 for larger fish (Figure \ref{fig:maturity}).

To date, there has been limited information regarding fecundity at age or length of `r spp`.  The 2013 stock assessment assumed that fecundity of female `r spp` was equal to biomass (Figure \ref{fig:fecundity_model}). Since the last full assessment, new research has been done examining the fecundity of `r spp` [@lefebvre_reproductive_nodate]. The study concluded a difference in fecundity between California and Washington `r spp` where a 40 cm fish in California is more fecund compared to  northern fish of the same size (Figure \ref{fig:fecundity}). However, northern fish of the largest size were more fecund relative to fish in California.  The current `r spp` model is a single area coastwide model, which assumes fish along the U.S. have the same biology (e.g. natural mortality, growth, fecundity). The estimates of fecundity for `r spp` were considered new data and based on the guidelines for update stock assessments, these data were not included in the base model. However, a sensitivity to including these data was provided. The next full assessment should include the new data about fecundity at length.

###Sex Ratio

Past assessments of `r spp` have assumed a 50% sex ratio between females and males off the U.S West Coast. Similarly, Canadian data from the 2004 published stock assessment also suggests sex ratios of `r spp` in British Columbia are generally 50% males and 50% females [@starr_petrale_2004]. To be consistent with the full assessment this update assessment retains the equal sex ratio assumption. However, examining the `r nwfsc` data the proportion of females in the population across the mid-range lengths is approximately 0.40 with the proportion increasing to 1 at the largest lengths due to dimorphic growth (Figure \ref{fig:sex_ratio}). The next full assessment should evaluate the sex ratio for `r spp`.  

###Length-Weight Relationship

The length-weight relationship for `r spp` was estimated outside the model using all biological data available from the `r nwfsc` data, where the female weight-at-length in grams was estimated at `r format(mod1$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Fem[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(mod1$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Fem[1],2)`^ and males at `r format(mod1$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Mal[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(mod1$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Mal[1], 2)`^ where $L$ is length in cm (Figures \ref{fig:wt_length}).


###Growth (Length-at-Age)

The length-at-age was estimated for male and female `r spp`. Figure \ref{fig:length_age} shows the lengths and ages as well as predicted von Bertalanffy fits to the data from the fishery and the `r nwfsc` data. Females grow larger than males and sex-specific growth parameters were estimated at the following values:

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{\infty}$ = 54; $k$ = 0.16

Males $L_{\infty}$ = 41; $k$ = 0.25

\end{centering}

These values were used as starting parameter values within the base model prior to estimating each parameter for male and female `r spp`.


###Ageing Precision and Bias

Historically, `r spp` otoliths have been read by multiple ageing labs using surface and break and burn methods. In order to conduct a comprehensive estimation of ageing bias and imprecision, the 2009 assessment compiled and analyzed all of the available double-read data from the state of Oregon, the Cooperative Aging Project (CAP), and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), as well information from a bomb radiocarbon age validation study for `r spp` off the U.S. West Coast [@haltuch_status_2009, @haltuch_california_2013]. 

The 2013 stock assessment applied read method and lab specific ageing error vectors [@haltuch_status_2013]. The same approach to ageing error based on data source are age reading method applied in the 2013 assessment was applied in this update stock assessment.  The ageing error vectors are shown in Tables \ref{tab:age_error1} and \ref{tab:age_error2}. For a detailed description please see the 2013 stock assessment [@haltuch_status_2013]. 

###Environmental and Ecosystem Data

This update assessment did not  evaluate potential ecosystem data and methodologies for `r spp`.
