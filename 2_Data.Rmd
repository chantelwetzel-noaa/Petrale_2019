##Fishery-Independent Data

###Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) Shelf-Slope Survey
Three sources of information are produced by this survey: an index of relative abundance, length-frequency distributions, and age-frequency distributions. Only years in which the NWFSC survey included the continental shelf (55-183 m) are considered (2003-2018), since the highest percent of positive survey tows with ` r spp` are found on the continental shelf.

The NWFSC shelf-slope survey is based on a random-grid design; covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55 m to 1,280 m (Keller et al. 2007). This design uses four industry chartered vessels per year, assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two 'passes' of the coast that are executed from north to south. Two vessels fish during each pass, which are conducted from late May to early October each year. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (~700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian border.

Length bins from 12 to 62 cm in 2 cm increments were used to summarize the length frequency of the survey catches in each year. Table \ref{NWcomb_Lengths} shows the number of lengths taken by the survey. The first bin includes all observations less than 14 cm and the last bin includes all fish larger than 62 cm. The length frequency distributions for the NWFSC survey from 2003-2018 generally show a strong cohort growing through 2005 and smaller fish entering the population beginning in 2007 rows (Figure XX). 

Age distributions included bins from age 1 to age 17, with the last bin including all fish of greater age. Table \ref{NWcomb_Ages} shows the number of ages taken by the survey. These data show the growth trajectory of females reaching a maximum size near 60 cm and males reaching a maximum size of about 54 cm (Figure XX). The marginal NWFSC shelf-slope survey age-compositions, which allow for easier viewing of strong cohorts, show the strong 1998 cohort ageing from 2003 to 2007, with younger fish appearing in 2008-2014 (Figure XX). The exception to this is the female composition in 2005, where only one female fish was aged from the tow with the largest catch rate. The expansion of numbers to tow can greatly affect the marginal age distribution, but does not have as much effect on the conditional age-at-length data.

###Triennial Shelf Survey
The Triennial shelf survey was first conducted by the AFSC in 1977 and spanned the time-frame from 1977-2004. The survey's design and sampling methods are most recently described in Weinberg et al. [-@weinberg_estimation_2002]. Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced transects from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated. The survey design has changed slightly over the period of time. In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid-summer through early fall: the 1977 survey was conducted from early July through late September; the surveys from 1980 through 1989 ran from mid-July to late September; the 1992 survey spanned from mid-July through early October; the 1995 survey was conducted from early June to late August; the 1998 survey ran from early June through early August; and the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted in May-July.

Haul depths ranged from 91-457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls shallower than 91 m. The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the West Coast south to $36.8^\circ$ N latitude and a depth range of 55-366 m. The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the southern range to $34.5^\circ$ N (near Point Conception). From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range 55-500 m and surveyed south to $34.5^\circ$ N. In the final year of the Triennial series, 2004, the NWFSC's Fishery Resource and Monitoring division (FRAM) conducted the survey and followed very similar protocols as the AFSC.

Due to changes in survey timing, the triennial shelf survey data have been split into independent early (1980-1992) and late (1995-2004) survey time series. The splitting of this time series was investigated during the 2009 STAR panel due to the changes in survey timing and the expected change in `r spp` catchability because of the stock's seasonal onshore-offshore migrations (Cook et al. 2009). For these reasons, as well as because the split improved fits to the
split time series and made small changes to the estimation of the selectivity curves, the 2009 STAR panel supported the split.

`r spp.up` were encountered throughout the West Coast (Figure XX). Larger catch rates were observed around depths of 100 m but no trend in catch rate was apparent over latitude, other than low catch rates in the Conception INPFC area which was only partially sampled (Figure XX 17). An analysis of the mean length by depth also showed evidence of an ontogenetic movement of petrale to deeper water (Figure XX 18), and depth stratification similar to the strata used for the NWFSC survey was used for the early and late triennial shelf survey (Table \ref{tab:strata_tri_early} and \ref{tab:strata_tri_late}).Strata were determined based on having an adequate sample size in each year-strata combination.

Table \ref{tab:Index_Summary}

Size distributions were calculated following the same procedures as the NWFSC survey. The numbers of fish and number of hauls represented in each year of the survey are presented in Table \ref{tab:Triennial_Lengths}. The length frequency distributions generally show little trend, although there is evidence of small fish in 1992 and large fish in 2004 (Figure XX).

There are no `r spp` age data from the triennial shelf survey.

##Fishery-Dependent Data

###Commercial Fishery Landings


###Discards

Data on discards of `r spp` are available from two different data sources.  The earliest source is referred to as the Pikitch data and comes from a study organized by Ellen Pikitch that collected trawl discards from 1985-1987 [@pikitch_evaluation_1988].  The northern and southern boundaries of the study were $48^\circ 42^\prime$ N latitude and $42^\circ 60^\prime$ N latitude respectively, which is primarily within the Columbia INPFC area [@pikitch_evaluation_1988; @rogers_numerical_1992].  Participation in the study was voluntary and included vessels using bottom, midwater, and shrimp trawl gears.  Observers of normal fishing operations on commercial vessels collected the data, estimated the total weight of the catch by tow, and recorded the weight of species retained and discarded in the sample.  Results of the Pikitch data were obtained from John Wallace (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA) in the form of ratios of discard weight to retained weight of `r spp` and sex-specific length frequencies.  Discard estimates are shown in Table \ref{tab:Discard}.   

The second source is from the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP).  This program is part of the NWFSC and has been recording discard observations since 2003. Table \ref{tab:Discard} shows the discard ratios (discarded/(discarded + retained)) of `r spp` from WCGOP.  Since 2011, when the trawl rationalization program was implemented, observer coverage rates increased to nearly 100% for all the limited entry trawl vessels in the program and discard rates declined compared to pre-2011 rates.  Discard rates were obtained for both the catch-share and the non-catch share sector for `r spp`.  A single discard rate was calculated by weighting discard rates based on the commercial landings by each sector.  Coefficient of variations were calculated for the non-catch shares sector and pre-catch share years by bootstrapping vessels within ports because the observer program randomly chooses vessels within ports to be observed. Post-ITQ, all catch-share vessels have 100% observer coverage and discarding is assumed to be known.

###Sex Ratio, Maturation, and Fecundity

Petrale sole maturity-at-length information is generally sparse in space and time, has not been collected in a systematic fashion across time, is of varying quality, and does not always agree between studies. It is possible that maturity may have changed over time. However, it is not possible to assess this quantitatively owing to differences in when historical samples on which maturity ogives could be based were taken, and how maturity stage (visual vs. histological) was determined. The 2005 petrale sole
assessment used the most recent study for the West Coast of the U.S. that was based on observations collected during 2002 from Oregon and Washington [@hannah_length_2002]. 



###Length-Weight Relationship

The length-weight relationship for `r spp` was estimated outside the model using all biological data available from the NWFSC shelf-slope survey data, where the female weight-at-length in grams was estimated at `r format(mod1$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Fem[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(mod1$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Fem[1],2)`^ and males at `r format(mod1$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Mal[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(mod1$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Mal[1], 2)`^ where $L$ is length in cm (Figures \ref{fig:Wt_len} and \ref{fig:Wt_len_pred}).
