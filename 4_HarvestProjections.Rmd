#Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

The forecast of stock abundance and yield was developed using the base model. The total catches in 2019 and 2020 are set at values provided by the Groundfish Management Team (GMT) of the PFMC at 2908 and 2845 mt, respectively. The management adopted ACL values for these years are 2921 and 2857 mt. The exploitation rate for 2021 and beyond is based upon an SPR of 30% and the 25:5 harvest control rule. The average exploitation rates, across recent years, by fleet as provided by the GMT were used to distribute catches during the forecast period. 

Uncertainty in the forecasts is based upon the uncertainty around the `r LastYR` spawning biomass, $\sigma$ = `r round(mod1$Pstar_sigma,2)`. The low and high values for female natural mortality, $M$, were selected to result in a spawning biomass in `r LastYR` that was equal to the 12.5 and 87.5% quantiles of the normal distribution given the maximum likelihood estimate and the asymptotic uncertainty. The female natural mortality values the corresponded with the lower and upper quantiles were 0.105 yr^-1^ and 0.205 yr^-1^. 

The ABC values were estimated using a category 1 $\sigma_y$ starting at 0.50 and increasing annually combined with a P* value of 0.45. The catches during the projection period were set equal to the year-specific ABC using the current flatfish harvest control rule, 25:5. The catches during the forecasted period are projected from the base model to start at 4115 mt in 2021 and decline to 3093 mt in 2030 as the stock declines towards the target spawning biomass (Table \ref{tab:OFL_projection_back}).  Across the low and high states of nature the relative biomass (depletion) ranges between 0.193 - 0.373 by the end of the 12-year projection period (Table \ref{tab:Decision_table_mod1}).
