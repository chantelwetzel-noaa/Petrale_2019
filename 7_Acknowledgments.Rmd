#Acknowledgments
Many people were instrumental in the successful completion of this assessment and their contribution is greatly appreciated.  This assessment draws heavily on the text and analyses from previous `r spp` assessments and has benefited greatly from the efforts of all authors contributing to those analyses. 

Alison Whitman (ODFW), Patrick Mirrick (ODFW), and Ted Calavan (ODFW) provided Oregon composition data, historical catches, corrected PacFIN catches, and quickly uploaded age data that were critical to this assessment.  Melissa Mandrup (CDFW) and Brenda Erwin (CDFW) provided timely answers and resolutions regarding with California data.  John Field (SWFSC) provided historical catch information and Don Pearson (SWFSC) compiled the extensive management changes for `r spp` which were critical in understanding and modeling fishery behavior.  John Wallace provided multiple last minute PacFIN extractions and analyzed historical discard rates for use in the assessment.

We are very grateful to Patrick McDonald and the team of agers at CAP for their hard work reading numerous otoliths and availability to answer questions when needed. ndAdditionally, we are appreciative of agers at WDFW who went above and beyond helping read the backlog of survey otoliths.  The work by Todd Hay and Beth Horness to streamline data access made data extraction and exploration easy.  They were always eager to help and answered numerous questions. Jason Jannot, Kate Richardson, and Kayleigh Sommers assisted with data from the WCGOP and entertained our many questions. We would like to acknowledge our survey team and their dedication to improving the assessments we do. 

The assessment was greatly improved through the streamlining of data processing tools (Kelli Johnson, Ian Taylor, Andi Stephens) and the many discussions within the Population Ecology team in the FRAM division at the NWFSC.

John Devore was an indispensable resource of the past, current, and future management as well as a great organizer and representative of the Pacific Fishery Management Council.
