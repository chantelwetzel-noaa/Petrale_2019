#Research Needs
There are many areas of research that could be improved to benefit the understanding and assessment of `r spp`. Below, are issues that are considered of importance.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Due to limited data, new studies on maturity  for `r spp` would be beneficial.

\item Studies on stock structure and movement of `r spp`, particularly with regard to the winter-summer spawning migration of `r spp` and the likely trans-boundary movement of `r spp` between U.S. and Canadian waters seasonally.

\item The extent of spatial variability on productivity processes such as growth, recruitment, and maturity is currently unknown and would benefit from further research.

\end{enumerate}
