	abstract = {As petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani) is a valuable groundﬁsh harvested in the California Current, proper ageing is important for its assessment and management. This study presents the ﬁrst bomb radiocarbon reference chronology for the California Current and petrale sole age validation. Break-and-burn and surface ages are negatively biased by approximately 1 year and 2–3 years, respectively. The reference and validation curves are more variable and show a lag in the rate of radiocarbon increase in comparison to most other time series of bomb radiocarbon in marine systems. Upwelling in the California Current produces a lagged rate of increase in radiocarbon levels owing to the introduction and mixing of radiocarbon-depleted deep waters with surface waters that interact with the atmosphere. The variable and lagged rate of radiocarbon increase in the petrale sole data may be due to their spending a substantial portion of their ﬁrst year of life in areas subject to variable upwelling, illustrating the importance of using reference curves for age validation that are region and species speciﬁc when possible.},
