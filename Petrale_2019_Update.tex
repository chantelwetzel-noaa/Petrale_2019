\section*{Executive Summary}\label{executive-summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Executive Summary}

\subsection*{Stock}\label{stock}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Stock}

This assessment reports the status of the petrale sole
(\emph{Eopsetta jordani}) off U.S. coast of California, Oregon, and
Washington using data through 2018. While petrale sole are modeled as a
single stock, the spatial aspects of the coast-wide population are
addressed through geographic separation of data sources/fleets where
possible. There is currently no genetic evidence suggesting distinct
biological stocks of petrale sole off the U.S. coast. The limited
tagging data available to describe adult movement suggests that petrale
sole may have some homing ability for deep water spawning sites but also
have the ability to move long distances between spawning sites,
inter-spawning season, as well as seasonally.

\subsection*{Landings}\label{landings}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Landings}

While records do not exist, the earliest catches of petrale sole are
reported in 1876 in California and 1884 in Oregon. In this assessment,
fishery removals have been divided among 4 fleets: 1) Winter North
trawl, 2) Summer North trawl, 3) Winter South trawl, and 4) Summer South
trawl. Landings for the North fleet are defined as fish landed in
Washington and Oregon ports. Landings for the South fleet are defined as
fish landed in California ports. Recent annual catches between 1981-2018
range between 755 and 3008 mt per year and the most recent year landings
are shown in Table \ref{tab:Exec_catch}. The landings are summarized
into winter and summer fleets where winter is defined as November to
February and summer running from March to October. Petrale sole are
caught nearly exclusively by trawl fleets; non-trawl gears contribute
only a small fraction of the catches across all years.

From the inception of the fishery through the war years, the vast
majority of catches occurred between March and October (the summer
fishery), when the stock is dispersed over the continental shelf. The
post-World War II period witnessed a steady decline in the amount and
proportion of annual catches occurring during the summer months
(March-October). Conversely, petrale sole catch during the winter season
(November-February), when the fishery targets spawning aggregations, has
exhibited a steadily increasing trend since the 1940s. From the
mid-1980s through the early 2000s, catches during the winter months were
roughly equivalent to or exceeded catches throughout the remainder of
the year, whereas during the past 10 years, the relative catches during
the winter and summer have been more variable across years (Table
\ref{tab:Exec_catch}). Petrale sole are a desirable market species and
discarding has historically been low.

Based on the 2005 assessment, annual catch limits (ACLs) were reduced to
2499 mt for 2007-2008. Following the 2009 assessment when the stock was
declared overfished, the ACLs were further reduced to 976 mt for 2011.
Since then, the ACLs and landings have subsequently increased to a high
value of 3,136 mt for 2017.

\subsection*{Data and Assessment}\label{data-and-assessment}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Data and Assessment}

This an update assessment for petrale sole, which was last assessed in
2013 and updated in 2015. This update assessment was conducted using the
length- and age-structured modeling software Stock Synthesis (version
3.30.13). The coastwide population was modeled allowing separate growth
and mortality parameters for each sex (a two-sex model) with the fishing
year beginning on November 1 and ending on October 31. The fisheries are
structured seasonally based on winter (November to February) and summer
(March to October) fishing seasons due to the development and growth of
the wintertime fishery, which began in the 1950s. In recent decades,
wintertime catches have often exceed summertime catches. The fisheries
modeled as the Winter North and Summer North fleets, where the North
includes both Washington and Oregon, and Southern Winter and Southern
Summer encompasses California fisheries.

The model includes fishery data in the form of catches, discard rates
and average weights, length- and age-frequency data, as well as
standardized winter fishery catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE). Biological
data are derived from both port and on-board observer sampling programs.
The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) AFSC/NWFSC West Coast
Triennial Shelf Survey early (1980, 1983, 1986, 1989, 1992) and late
period (1995, 1998, 2001, and 2004) and the NWFSC West Coast Groundfish
Bottom Trawl Survey (2003-2018) relative biomass indices and biological
sampling provide fishery independent information on relative trend and
demographics of the petrale sole stock.

\subsection*{Updated Data}\label{updated-data}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Updated Data}

The base assessment model structure is consistent with the 2013
assessment and the 2015 update, except as noted here. Modifications from
the previous assessment model include:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Commercial catches (2015-2018 added);
  \item Commercial length and age data (all years reprocessed, 2015-2018 added);
  \item Observed discard rates, average weights, and lengths (2002-2017 reprocessed, 2014-2017 added); 
  \item AFSC/NWFSC West Coast Triennial Shelf Survey early and late indices of abundance and length composition data (1980-2004 reprocessed); 
  \item NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey index of abundance, length and age composition data (2003-2018 reprocessed, 2015-2018 added);
  \item Model tuning to re-weight data using the McAllister and Iannelli approach (same approach applied in the 2013 assessment);
  \item Length-weight relationship parameters estimated outside of the stock assessment model from the NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey data up to 2018 and input as fixed values;
  \item Updated the natural mortality prior for female and male fish; and,
  \item Model fitting using latest version of Stock Synthesis (SS v.3.30.13). 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Stock Biomass}\label{stock-biomass}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Stock Biomass}

Petrale sole were lightly exploited during the early 1900s, but by the
1950s, the fishery was well developed with the stock showing declines in
biomass and catches (Figures \ref{fig:Exec_catch1} and
\ref{fig:Spawnbio_all}). The rate of decline in spawning biomass
accelerated through the 1970s reaching minimums generally around or
below 10\% of the unexploited levels during the 1980s through the early
2000s (Figure \ref{fig:RelDeplete_all}). The petrale sole spawning stock
biomass is estimated to have increased in recent years due to reduced
catches during rebuilding and in response to above average recruitment
in 2006, 2007, and 2008. The 2019 estimated spawning biomass relative to
unfished equilibrium spawning biomass is above the target of 25\% of
unfished spawning biomass at 39.1\% (\(\sim\) 95\% asymptotic interval:
\(\pm\) 28.2\%-50.1\%) (Table \ref{tab:SpawningDeplete_mod1}).

\subsection*{Recruitment}\label{recruitment}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Recruitment}

Annual recruitment was treated as stochastic, and estimated as annual
deviations from log-mean recruitment where mean recruitment is the
fitted Beverton-Holt stock recruitment curve. The time-series of
estimated recruitments shows a relationship with the decline in spawning
biomass, punctuated by larger recruitments in 2006, 2007, and 2008
(Figure \ref{fig:Recruits_all}). However, recruitment in recent years
(2013 - 2017) is estimated to be less than the expected mean recruitment
indicating an absence of strong incoming recruitment (Table
\ref{tab:Recruit_mod1}).

The five largest estimated recruitments estimated within the model (in
ascending order) occurred in 2006, 1998, 1966, 2007, and 2008. The four
lowest recruitments estimated within the model (in ascending order)
occurred in 1986, 1992, 1987, and 2003.

\subsection*{Exploitation Status}\label{exploitation-status}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Exploitation Status}

The relative spawning biomass of petrale sole was estimated to have
dropped below the management target (25\%) for the first time in 1965.
The stock continued to decline and first fell below the minimum stock
size threshold level of 12.5\% in 1980 (although, at the time the
management target and thresholds were not set at the current values of
25\% and 12.5\%). The relative spawning biomass remained around the
threshold stock size until approximately 2010, with the stock reaching
its lowest relative spawning biomass level in 1993 at 5.8\%. In 2009
petrale sole was formally declared overfished. Fishing mortality rates
sharply declined during the rebuilding period, relative to previous year
rates, which exceeded the target (Figure \ref{fig:SPR_all}). After
reduced harvests, the 2015 update stock assessment estimated the stock
to have rebuilt to the management target (25\%) in 2014. This update
estimates that the relative spawning biomass exceeded 25\% in 2013 with
harvest rates in the most recent years remaining under of the target
rate (Table \ref{tab:SPR_Exploit_mod1} and Figures \ref{fig:SPR_all} and
\ref{fig:Phase_all}).

\subsection*{Ecosystem Considerations}\label{ecosystem-considerations}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Ecosystem Considerations}

Ecosystem factors have not been explicitly modeled in this assessment,
but there are several aspects of the California current ecosystem that
may impact petrale sole population dynamics and warrant further
research. Castillo
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-castillo_g.c._fluctuations_1992}{1992}) and
Castillo et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-castillo_latitudinal_1995}{1995}) suggest that
density-independent survival of early life stages is low and show that
offshore Ekman transportation of eggs and larvae may be an important
source of variation in year-class strength in the Columbia INPFC area.
The effects of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation on California current
temperature and productivity (Mantua et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-mantua_pacific_1997}{1997}) may also contribute
to non-stationary recruitment dynamics for petrale sole. The prevalence
of a strong late 1990s year-class for many West Coast groundfish species
suggests that environmentally driven recruitment variation may be
correlated among species with relatively diverse life history
strategies. Although current research efforts along these lines are
limited, a more explicit exploration of ecosystem processes may be
possible in future petrale sole stock assessments if resources are
available for such investigations.

\subsection*{Reference Points}\label{reference-points}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Reference Points}

This update stock assessment estimates that the spawning biomass of
petrale sole is above the management target. Due to reduced landings and
a series of above average recruitments (2006, 2007, and 2008), an
increasing trend in spawning biomass was estimated in the base model
with a decline in the start of the year spawning biomass estimate in
2019. The estimated relative spawning biomass in 2019 is 39.1\%
(\(\sim\) 95\% asymptotic interval: \(\pm\) 28.2\%-50.1\%),
corresponding to an spawning biomass of 13,078 mt (\(\sim\) 95\%
asymptotic interval: 10,689-15,467 mt) (Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}).
Unfished age 3+ biomass was estimated to be 54,086.6 mt in the base
model.

The target spawning biomass based on the biomass target (\(SB_{25\%}\))
is 8,351.5 mt, with an equilibrium catch of 3,148.5 mt (Table
\ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}). Equilibrium yield at the proxy \(F_{MSY}\)
harvest rate corresponding to \(SPR_{30\%}\) is 3,135.2 mt. Estimated
MSY catch is at a 3,156.7 spawning biomass of 7,563.3 mt (22.6\%
relative spawning biomass).

\subsection*{Management Performance}\label{management-performance}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Management Performance}

The 2009 stock assessment estimated petrale sole to be at 11.6\% of
unfished spawning stock biomass. Based on the 2009 stock assessment, the
2010 coast-wide ACL was reduced to 1,200 mt to reflect the overfished
status of the stock and the 2011 coast-wide overfishing limit (OFL) and
ACL were set at 1,021 mt and 976 mt, respectively (Table
\ref{tab:mnmgt_perform}).

Recent coast-wide annual landings have not exceeded the ACL. The 2009,
2011, and 2013 full assessments estimated that petrale sole have been
below the management target since the 1960s and below the overfished
threshold between the early 1980s and 009 with fishing mortality rates
in excess of the current F-target for flatfish of \(SPR_{30\%}\). The
2015 update assessment estimated that the stock had recovered with the
relative spawning biomass exceeding the management target.

\subsection*{Unresolved Problems and Major
Uncertainties}\label{unresolved-problems-and-major-uncertainties}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Unresolved Problems and Major
Uncertainties}

Parameter uncertainty is explicitly captured in the asymptotic
confidence intervals reported throughout this assessment for key
parameters and management quantities. These intervals reflect the
uncertainty in the model fit to the data sources included in the
assessment, but do not include uncertainty associated with alternative
model configurations, weighting of data sources (a combination of input
sample sizes and relative weighting of likelihood components), or fixed
parameters.

There are a number of major uncertainties regarding model parameters
that have been explored via sensitivity analysis. The most notable
explorations involved the sensitivity of model estimates to:

\begin{enumerate}

\item The value of natural mortality by sex.

\item The current sex ratio between female and males in the population of petrale sole.

\item Fecundity estimates based upon new research for petrale sole and measured differences in fecundity between northern and southern fish.

\item Changes in the model estimates based on alternative data weighting approaches.

\end{enumerate}

Additionally, to date a reconstructed historical Washington catch
history has not been included in the petrale sole stock assessment.
Washington state is currently undergoing efforts to determine historical
catches for petrale sole and next assessment is likely to incorporate
these new historical catch estimates.

\subsection*{Decision Table}\label{decision-table}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Decision Table}

The forecast of stock abundance and yield was developed using the base
model. The total catches in 2019 and 2020 are set at values provided by
the Groundfish Management Team (GMT) of the PFMC at 2908 and 2845 mt,
respectively. The management adopted ACL values for these years are 2921
and 2857 mt. The exploitation rate for 2021 and beyond is based upon an
SPR of 30\% and the 25:5 harvest control rule. The average exploitation
rates, across recent years, by fleet as provided by the GMT were used to
distribute catches during the forecast period.

Uncertainty in the forecasts is based upon the three states of nature
based on the likelihood profile of female natural mortality (\(M\)),
chosen using a change of 1.2 NLL units (75\% interval) from the minimum
value to correspond to the midpoints of the lower 25\% probability and
upper 25\% probability regions from the base model and are low (0.130
yr\textsuperscript{-1}) and high (0.185 yr\textsuperscript{-1}) values
for female natural mortality.

Catches during the projection period under the current harvest control
rule are projected to start at 4115 mt and decline over the projection
period to 3093 mt, in the base model, as the stock declines towards that
target spawning biomass (Table \ref{tab:OFL_projection}). Across the low
and high states of nature the under the current harvest control rule,
the relative biomass (depletion) range between 0.24 - 0.34 by the end of
the 12-year projection period (Table \ref{tab:Decision_table_mod1_es}).

\subsection*{Research and Data Needs}\label{research-and-data-needs}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Research and Data Needs}

Progress on a number of research topics and data issues would
substantially improve the ability of this assessment to reliably and
precisely model petrale sole population dynamics in the future:

\begin{enumerate}

\item In the past many assessments have derived historical catches independently. The states of California and Oregon have completed comprehensive historical catch reconstructions. At the time of this assessment, a comprehensive historical catch reconstruction is not available for Washington. Completion of a Washington catch reconstruction would provide the best possible estimated catch series that accounts for all the catch and better resolves historical catch uncertainty for flatfish as a group.

\item Due to limited data, new studies on the maturity at length or age for petrale sole would be beneficial.

\item Where possible, historical otolith samples aged using a combination of surface and break-and-burn methods should be re-aged using the break-and-burn method. Early surface read otoliths should also be re-aged using the break-and-burn method. Historical otoliths aged with a standard method will allow the further evaluation of the potential impacts of consistent under ageing using surface methods, changes in selectivity during early periods of time without any composition information, and potential changes in growth.

\item Studies on stock structure and movement of petrale sole, particularly with regard to the winter-summer spawning migration of petrale sole and the likely trans-boundary movement of petrale sole between U.S. and Canadian waters seasonally.

\item The extent of spatial variability on productivity processes such as growth, recruitment, and maturity is currently unknown and would benefit from further research.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

This update assessment does not attempt to reiterate all background
information for petrale sole presented in the 2013 assessment document.
Instead, only a few key assumptions are restated, along with a detailed
description of changes made during the course of the update. Those
interested in a more complete description of petrale sole life-history
and the details of previous assessments should refer to the 2013
assessment (Haltuch et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2013}{2013}\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2013}{b}).

\subsection{Basic Information}\label{basic-information}

Petrale sole (\emph{Eopsetta jordani}) is a right-eyed flounder in the
family Pleuronectidae ranging from the western Gulf of Alaska to the
Coronado Islands, northern Baja California (Kramer et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-kramer_guide_1995}{1995}, Love et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-love_milton_resource_2005}{2005}) with a
preference for soft substrates at depths ranging from 0-550 m (Love et
al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-love_milton_resource_2005}{2005}). Common
names include brill, California sole, Jordan's flounder, cape sole,
round nose sole, English sole, soglia, petorau, nameta, and tsubame
garei (Smith \protect\hyperlink{ref-smith_report_1937}{1937}, Gates and
Frey \protect\hyperlink{ref-gates_designated_1974}{1974}, Eschmeyer and
Herald \protect\hyperlink{ref-eschmeyer_field_1983}{1983}, Love
\protect\hyperlink{ref-love_milton_probably_1996}{1996}). In northern
and central California petrale sole are dominant on the middle and outer
continental shelf. PacFIN fishery logbook data show that adults are
caught in depths from 18 to 1,280 m off the U.S. West Coast with a
majority of the catches of petrale sole being taken between 70-220 m
during March through October, and between 290-440 m during November
through February.

Past assessments completed by Demory
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-demory_progress_1984}{1984},), Turnock et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-turnock_status_1993}{1993}), and Sampson and Lee
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sampson_assessment_1999}{1999}) considered
petrale sole in the Columbia and U.S.-Vancouver INPFC areas a single
stock. Sampson and Lee (1999) assumed that petrale sole in the Eureka
and Monterey INPFC areas represented two additional distinct socks. The
2005 petrale sole assessment assumed two stocks, northern
(U.S.-Vancouver and Columbia INPFC areas) and southern (Eureka, Monterey
and Conception INPFC areas), to maintain continuity with previous
assessments. Three stocks (West Coast Vancouver Island, Queen Charlotte
Sound, and Heceta Strait) are considered for petrale sole in the waters
off British Columbia, Canada (Starr and Fargo
\protect\hyperlink{ref-starr_petrale_2004}{2004}). The 2009, 2011, 2013,
and 2015 assessments integrate the previously separate north-south
assessments to provide a coast-wide status evaluation. The decision to
conduct a single-area assessment is based on strong evidence of a mixed
stock from tagging studies, a lack of genetic studies on stock
structure, and a lack of evidence for differences in growth between the
2005 northern and southern assessment areas and from examination of the
fishery size-at-age data, as well as confounding differences in data
collection between Washington, Oregon, and California. This 2019 update
assessment provides a coast-wide status evaluation for petrale sole
using data through 2018.

Fishing fleets are separated both geographically and seasonally to
account for spatial and seasonal patterns in catch given the coast-wide
assessment area. The petrale sole fisheries possess a distinct
seasonality, with catches peaking during the winter months, so the
fisheries are divided into winter (November-February) and summer
(March-October) fisheries. Note that the ``fishing year'' for this
assessment (November 1 to October 31) differs from the standard calendar
year. The U.S.-Canadian border is the northern boundary for the assessed
stock, although the basis for this choice is due to political and
current management needs rather than the population dynamics. Given the
lack of clear information regarding the status of distinct biological
populations, this assessment treats the U.S. Petrale sole resource from
the Mexican border to the Canadian border as a single coast-wide stock.

\subsection{Life History}\label{life-history}

Petrale sole spawn during the winter at several discrete deep water
sites (270-460 m) off the U.S. West Coast, from November to April, with
peak spawning taking place from December to February (Harry
\protect\hyperlink{ref-harry_time_1959}{1959}, Best
\protect\hyperlink{ref-best_petrale_1960}{1960}, Gregory and Jow
\protect\hyperlink{ref-gregory_validity_1976}{1976}, Castillo et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-castillo_g.c._environmental_1993}{1993}, Reilly
et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-reilly_recreational_1994}{1994}, Love
\protect\hyperlink{ref-love_milton_probably_1996}{1996}). Females spawn
once each year and fecundity varies with fish size, with one large
female laying as many as 1.5 million eggs (Porter
\protect\hyperlink{ref-porter_notes_1964}{1964}). Petrale sole eggs are
planktonic, ranging in size from 1.2 to 1.3 mm, and are found in deep
water habitats at water temperatures of 4-10 degrees C and salinities of
25-30 ppt (Best \protect\hyperlink{ref-best_petrale_1960}{1960}, Ketchen
and Forrester \protect\hyperlink{ref-ketchen_population_1966}{1966},
Alderdice and Forrest
\protect\hyperlink{ref-alderdice_effects_1971}{1971}, Gregory and Jow
\protect\hyperlink{ref-gregory_validity_1976}{1976}). The duration of
the egg stage can range from approximately 6 to 14 days (Alderdice and
Forrest \protect\hyperlink{ref-alderdice_effects_1971}{1971}, Love
\protect\hyperlink{ref-love_milton_probably_1996}{1996}). The most
favorable conditions for egg incubation and larval growth are 6-7
degrees C and 27.5-29.5 ppt (Ketchen and Forrester
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ketchen_population_1966}{1966}, Alderdice and
Forrest \protect\hyperlink{ref-alderdice_effects_1971}{1971}, Castillo
\protect\hyperlink{ref-castillo_latitudinal_1995}{1995}).

Adult petrale sole achieve a maximum size of around 50 cm and 63 cm for
males and females, respectively (Best
\protect\hyperlink{ref-best_e.a._movements_1963}{1963}, Pedersen
\protect\hyperlink{ref-pedersen_movements_1975}{1975}). The maximum
length reported for petrale sole is 70 cm (Eschmeyer and Herald
\protect\hyperlink{ref-eschmeyer_field_1983}{1983}, Love et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-love_milton_resource_2005}{2005}) while the
maximum observed break-and-burn age is 34 years (observed in 2003 by the
NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey survey).

\subsection{Historical and Current Fishery
Information}\label{historical-and-current-fishery-information}

Petrale sole have been caught in the flatfish fishery off the U.S.
Pacific coast since the late 19th century. The fishery first developed
off of California where, prior to 1876, fishing in San Francisco Bay was
by hand or set lines and beach seining (Scofield
\protect\hyperlink{ref-scofield_trawling_1948}{1948}). By 1880 two San
Francisco based trawler companies were running a total of six boats,
extending the fishing grounds beyond the Golden Gate Bridge northward to
Point Reyes (Scofield
\protect\hyperlink{ref-scofield_trawling_1948}{1948}). Steam trawlers
entered the fishery during 1888 and 1889, and four steam tugs based out
of San Francisco were sufficient to flood market with flatfish (Scofield
\protect\hyperlink{ref-scofield_trawling_1948}{1948}). By 1915 San
Francisco and Santa Cruz trawlers were operating at depths of about
45-100 m with catches averaging 10,000 lbs per tow or 3,000 lbs per hour
(Scofield \protect\hyperlink{ref-scofield_trawling_1948}{1948}).
Flatfish comprised approximately 90\% of the catch with 20-25\% being
discarded as unmarketable (Scofield
\protect\hyperlink{ref-scofield_trawling_1948}{1948}). During 1915 laws
were enacted that prohibited dragging in California waters and making it
illegal to possess a trawl net from Santa Barbara County southward
(Scofield \protect\hyperlink{ref-scofield_trawling_1948}{1948}). By 1934
twenty 56-72 foot diesel engine trawlers operated out of San Francisco
fishing between about 55 and 185 m (Scofield
\protect\hyperlink{ref-scofield_trawling_1948}{1948}). From 1944-1947
the number of California trawlers fluctuated between 16 and 46 boats
(Scofield \protect\hyperlink{ref-scofield_trawling_1948}{1948}).
Although the flatfish fishery in California was well developed by the
1950s and 1960s, catch statistics were not reported until 1970 (Heimann
and Carlisle \protect\hyperlink{ref-heimann_pacific_1970}{1970}). In
this early California report petrale sole landings during 1916 to 1930
were not separated from the total flatfish landings.

The earliest trawl fishing off Oregon began during 1884-1885, and the
fishery was solidly established by 1937, with the fishery increasing
rapidly during WWII (Harry and Morgan, 1961). Initially trawlers stayed
close to the fishing grounds adjacent to Newport and Astoria, operating
at about 35-90 m between Stonewall Bank and Depoe Bay. Fishing
operations gradually extended into deep water. For example,
Newport-based trawlers were commonly fishing at about 185 m in 1949, at
about 185-365 m by 1952, and at about 550 m by 1953.

Alverson and Chatwin
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-alverson_results_1957}{1957}) describe the
history of the petrale sole fishery off of Washington and British
Columbia with fishing grounds ranging from Cape Flattery to Destruction
Island. Petrale sole catches off of Washington were small until the late
1930s with the fishery extending to about 365 m following the
development of deep water rockfish fisheries during the 1950s.

By the 1950s the petrale sole fishery was showing signs of depletion
with reports suggesting that petrale sole abundance had declined by at
least 50\% from 1942 to 1947 (Harry
\protect\hyperlink{ref-harry_analysis_1956}{1956}). Sampson and Lee
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sampson_assessment_1999}{1999}) reported that
three fishery regulations were implemented during 1957-67: 1) a winter
closure off Oregon, Washington and British Columbia, 2) a 3,000 lb per
trip limit, and 3) no more than two trips per month during 1957. With
the 1977 enactment of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management
Act (MFCMA) the large foreign-dominated fishery that had developed since
the late 1960s was replaced by the domestic fishery that continues
today. Petrale sole are harvested almost exclusively by bottom trawls in
the U.S. West Coast groundfish fishery. Recent petrale sole catches
exhibit marked seasonal variation, with substantial portions of the
annual harvest taken from the spawning grounds during December and
January. Evidence suggests that the winter fishery on the deep water
spawning grounds developed sporadically during the 1950s and 1960s as
fishers discovered new locations (e.g., Alverson and Chatwin
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-alverson_results_1957}{1957}); Ketchen and
Forrester (\protect\hyperlink{ref-ketchen_population_1966}{1966})). Both
historical and current petrale sole fisheries have primarily relied upon
trawl fleets. Fishery removals were divided among 4 fleets: 1) winter
North trawl, 2) summer North trawl, 3) winter South trawl, and 4) summer
South trawl. Landings for the North fleet are defined as fish landed in
Washington and Oregon ports. Landings for the South fleet are defined as
fish landed in California ports.

Historical landings reconstructions show peak catches from the summer
fishery occurred during the 1940s and 1950s and subsequently declined,
during which time the fleet moved to fishing in deeper waters during the
winter. After the period of peak landings during the 1940s and 1950s,
total landings were somewhat stable until about the late 1970s, and then
generally declined until the mid-2000s. (Table \ref{tab:Comm_Catch} and
Figure \ref{fig:Catch}). During 2009 the fishery was declared overfished
and during 2010 management restrictions limited the catch to 755 mt
(Table \ref{tab:Comm_Catch} and Figure \ref{fig:Catch}). Recent years
overfishing limit (OFL), annual catch limit (ACL), landings, and
estimated total dead are shown in Table \ref{tab:mnmgt_perform_tables}.

\subsection{Summary of Management History and
Performance}\label{summary-of-management-history-and-performance}

Beginning in 1983 the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC)
established coast-wide annual catch limits (ACLs) for the annual
harvests of petrale sole in the waters off the U.S. West Coast. The
first assessment of West Coast petrale sole occurred in 1984 (Demory
\protect\hyperlink{ref-demory_progress_1984}{1984}). Based on the 1999
assessment a coast-wide ACL of 2,762 mt was specified and remained
unchanged between 2001 and 2006.

The 2005 assessment of petrale sole stock assessment split the stock
into two areas, the northern area that included U.S.-Vancouver and
Columbia INPFC areas and the southern area that included the Eureka,
Monterey and Conception INPFC areas (Lai et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-lai_stock_2005}{2005}). While petrale sole stock
structure is not well understood, CPUE and geographical differences
between states were used to support the use of two separate assessment
areas. In 2005 petrale sole were estimated to be at 34 and 29\% of
unfished spawning stock biomass in the northern and southern areas,
respectively. In spite of different models and data, the biomass trends
were qualitatively similar in both areas, providing support for a
coast-wide stock. This assessment estimated that petrale sole had
historically been below the Pacific Council's minimum stock size
threshold of 25\% of unfished biomass from the mid-1970s until just
prior to the completion of the assessment, with estimated harvest rates
in excess of the target fishing mortality rate implemented for petrale
sole at that time (\(\text{F}_{40\%}\)). However, the 2005 stock
assessment determined that the stock was in the precautionary zone and
was not overfished (i.e., the spawning stock biomass was not below 25\%
of the unfished spawning stock biomass). Based on the 2005 stock
assessment results, ACLs were set at 3,025 mt and 2,919 mt for 2007 and
2008, respectively, with an ACT of 2,499 mt for both years.

In comparison to the 1999 assessment of petrale sole, the 2005
assessment represented a significant change in the perception of petrale
sole stock status. The stock assessment conducted in 1999
(Washington-Oregon only) estimated the spawning stock biomass in 1998 at
39\% of unfished stock biomass. Although the estimates of 1998
spawning-stock biomass were little changed between the 1999 and 2005
(Northern area) assessments, the estimated depletion in the 2005
assessment was much lower. The change in status between the 1999 and
2005 analyses was due to the introduction of a reconstructed catch
history in 2005, which spanned the entire period of removals. The 1999
stock assessment used a catch history that started in 1977, after the
bulk of the removals from the fishery had already taken place. Thus the
1999 stock assessment produced a more optimistic view of the petrale
stock's level of depletion. The stock's estimated decline in status
between the 2005 and 2009 assessments was driven primarily by a
significant decline in the trawl-survey index over that period. The 2011
assessment concluded that the stock status continued to be below the
target of 25\% of unfished biomass.

The 2009 coast-wide stock assessment estimated that the petrale sole
stock had declined from its 2005 high to 11.6\% of the unfished spawning
stock biomass (Haltuch and Hicks
\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2009}{2009}). The petrale sole was
declared overfished based on newly adopted management targets (e.g.,
target spawning biomass for flatfish stocks defined as 25\% and
overfished threshold of 12.5\% of unfished spawning stock biomass)
resulting in a rebuilding plan and catch restrictions for petrale sole.
The stock was declared rebuilt based on the results of the 2015 update
stock assessment which estimated the coastwide biomass at 30.7\% of
unfished spawning stock output with ACLs of 3,136 and 3,013 in 2017 and
2018 respectively (Stawitz et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-stawitz_stock_2015}{2015}).

For additional information on changes in the petrale sole fishery please
see the 2013 stock assessment (Haltuch et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2013}{2013}\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2013}{b}).

\subsection{Fisheries off Canada and
Alaska}\label{fisheries-off-canada-and-alaska}

The Canadian fishery developed rapidly during the late 1940s to
mid-1950s following the discovery of petrale sole spawning aggregations
off the West Coast of Vancouver Island (Anon
\protect\hyperlink{ref-anon_fish_2001}{2001}). Annual landings of
petrale sole in British Columbia peaked at 4,800 mt in 1948 but declined
significantly after the mid-1960s (Anon
\protect\hyperlink{ref-anon_fish_2001}{2001}). By the 1970s, analysis
conducted by Pederson
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-pedersen_movements_1975}{1975}) suggested that
petrale sole abundance was low and abundance remained low into the
1990s. In the early 1990s vessel trip quotas were established to try to
halt the decline in petrale sole abundance (Anon
\protect\hyperlink{ref-anon_fish_2001}{2001}). Winter quarter landings
of petrale sole were limited to 44,000 lb per trip during 1985-91; to
10,000 lb per trip during 1991-95; and to 2,000 lb per trip in 1996.
Biological data collected during 1980-1996 showed a prolonged decline in
the proportion of young fish entering the population (Anon
\protect\hyperlink{ref-anon_fish_2001}{2001}). Therefore, no directed
fishing for petrale sole has been permitted in Canada since 1996 due to
a continuing decline in long term abundance (Fargo
\protect\hyperlink{ref-fargo_j.j._flatfish_1997}{1997}, Anon
\protect\hyperlink{ref-anon_fish_2001}{2001}). As of 2005 petrale sole
off of British Columbia were treated as three ``stocks'' and were still
considered to be at low levels. The recent assessments for the Canadian
stocks have been based on catch histories and limited biological data.

In Alaska petrale sole are not targeted in the Bering Sea/Aleutian
Island fisheries and are managed as a minor species in the ``Other
Flatfish'' stock complex.

\section{Data}\label{data}

Data used in the petrale sole assessment are summarized in Figure
\ref{fig:data_plot}. The data that were added or reprocessed for this
assessment are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Commercial catches (2015-2018 added);
  \item Commercial length and age data (all years reprocessed, 2015-2018 added);
  \item Observed discard rates, average weights, and lengths (2002-2017 reprocessed, 2014-2017 added); 
  \item AFSC/NWFSC West Coast Triennial Shelf Survey early and late indices of abundance and length composition data (1980-2004 reprocessed); and
  \item NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey index of abundance, length and age composition data (2003-2018 reprocessed, 2015-2018 added).
\end{enumerate}

A description of each data source is provided below.

\subsection{Fishery-Independent Data}\label{fishery-independent-data}

\subsubsection{NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl
Survey}\label{nwfsc-west-coast-groundfish-bottom-trawl-survey}

Three sources of information are produced by this survey: an index of
relative abundance, length-frequency distributions, and age-frequency
distributions. Only years in which the NWFSC West Coast Groundfish
Bottom Trawl Survey included the continental shelf (55-183 m) are
considered (2003-2018), since the highest percent of positive survey
tows with petrale sole are found on the continental shelf.

The NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey is based on a
random-grid design; covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55 m to
1,280 m (Bradburn et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-bradburn_2003_2011}{2011}). This design generally
uses four industry chartered vessels per year, assigned to a roughly
equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two
`passes' of the coast that are executed from north to south. Two vessels
fish during each pass, which are conducted from late May to early
October each year. This design therefore incorporates both
vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability as well as variance
associated with selecting a relatively small number
(\textasciitilde{}700) of possible cells from a very large set of
possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian border.

The NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey commonly encounters
petrale sole along the U.S West Coast, except south of Point Conception
(Figure \ref{fig:nw_map}). The catch-per-unit-effort estimated from the
survey is roughly constant north of 38\(^\circ\) (Figure
\ref{fig:nw_cpue_lat}). The survey does fish shallower than 54 m and the
encounter rate of petrale sole declines at waters deeper than 400 m.
Figure \ref{fig:nw_cpue_depth} shows that the positive tows catch rate
by depth peaks between 100-200 meters and declines as depth increases.
The observed lengths captured across depths by the survey are shown in
Figure \ref{fig:nwfsc_size_depth}.

The data from the NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey was
analyzed using a spatio-temporal delta model implemented as an R
package, VAST (Thorson and Barnett
\protect\hyperlink{ref-thorson_comparing_2017}{2017}, Thorson
\protect\hyperlink{ref-thorson_guidance_2019}{2019}), which is publicly
available online (\url{https://github.com/James-Thorson/VAST}). Spatial
and spatio-temporal variation is specifically included in both encounter
probability and positive catch rates, a logit-link for encounter
probability and a log-link for positive catch rates. Vessel-year effects
were included for each unique combination of vessel and year in the data
to account for the random selection of commercial vessels used during
sampling (Helser et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-helser_generalized_2004}{2004}, Thorson and Ward
\protect\hyperlink{ref-thorson_accounting_2013}{2013}). Spatial
variation was approximated using 250 knots, and the model used the
bias-correction algorithm (Thorson and Kristensen
\protect\hyperlink{ref-thorson_implementing_2016}{2016}) in Template
Model Builder (Kristensen et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-kristensen_tmb:_2016}{2016}). Further details
regarding model structure are available in the user manual
(\url{https://github.com/James-Thorson/VAST/blob/} master/examples/VAST
user manual.pdf).

The gamma distribution with random strata-year and vessel effects was
chosen as the final model. The Q-Q plot does not show any departures
from the assumed distribution (Figure \ref{fig:nw_qq}). The Pearson
residuals for the encounter and catch rates for gamma distribution model
are shown in Figures \ref{fig:nw_enc_rate} and \ref{fig:nw_catch_rate}.

The estimated index of abundance is given in Table
\ref{tab:Index_Summary}. For comparison, the 2015 model estimated, the
2019 design based, and the 2019 VAST indices are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:nw_index}. The spatial density by year estimated by VAST is
shown in Figure \ref{fig:nw_density}. The index for the NWFSC West Coast
Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey shows an increase in the population
between 2009 and 2014 and roughly stable through 2017, and decrease in
the index in the most recent year, 2018.

Length bins from 12 to 62 cm in 2 cm increments were used to summarize
the length frequency of the survey catches in each year. The first
length bin includes all observations less than 14 cm and the last bin
includes all fish larger than 62 cm. Table \ref{tab:NWcombo_Lengths}
shows the number of lengths taken by the survey. The length frequency
distributions for the NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey
from 2003-2018 generally show an increased frequency in observations of
smaller fish between 2007 and 2011 (Figure \ref{fig:nw_len_freq}). The
stratification for length data expansion based on the design-based
estimates is provided in Table \ref{tab:strata_nwfsc}.

Age distributions included bins from age 1 to age 17, with the last bin
including all fish of greater age. Table \ref{tab:NWcombo_Ages} shows
the number of ages taken by the survey. The marginal NWFSC West Coast
Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey age-compositions, which allow for easier
viewing of strong cohorts, show the strong 1998 cohort ageing from 2003
to 2007, with younger fish appearing between 2008-2011 (Figure
\ref{fig:nw_age_freq}). The exception to this is the female composition
in 2005, where only one female fish estimated to be age 3 was aged from
the tow with the largest catch rate.

The input sample sizes for length and marginal age-composition data for
all fishery-independent surveys were calculated based on the approach
used in the 2013 full and 2015 update assessment as:

\begin{centering}

$\text{Input N} = (0.138*(\sum_{}^{N} \text{fish}_{y} / \sum_{}^{N} \text{tows}_{y}) + 1)*\sum_{}^{N} \text{tows}_y$ 

\end{centering}

where fish is the number of petrale sole by year \(y\) and \(N\) the
total number of tows by year. The input sample size of
conditional-age-at-length data was set at the number of fish at each
length by sex and by year. The conditional-age-at-length data were not
expanded and were binned according to length, age, sex, and year.

\subsubsection{AFSC/NWFSC West Coast Triennial Shelf
Survey}\label{afscnwfsc-west-coast-triennial-shelf-survey}

The AFSC/NWFSC West Coast Triennial Shelf Survey (referred to as the
Triennial Survey for short) was first conducted by the AFSC in 1977 and
spanned the time-frame from 1977-2004. The survey's design and sampling
methods are most recently described in Weinberg et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-weinberg_2001_2002}{2002}). Its basic design was
a series of equally-spaced transects from which searches for tows in a
specific depth range were initiated. The survey design has changed
slightly over time. In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the
mid-summer through early fall: the 1977 survey was conducted from early
July through late September; the surveys from 1980 through 1989 ran from
mid-July to late September; the 1992 survey spanned from mid-July
through early October; the 1995 survey was conducted from early June to
late August; the 1998 survey ran from early June through early August;
and the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted in May-July.

Haul depths ranged from 91-457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls
shallower than 91 m. The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the
West Coast south to \(36.8^\circ\) N latitude and a depth range of
55-366 m. The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but
extended the southern range to \(34.5^\circ\) N (near Point Conception).
From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range 55-500 m and
surveyed south to \(34.5^\circ\) N. In the final year of the Triennial
Survey series, 2004, the NWFSC's Fishery Resource and Monitoring
division (FRAM) conducted the survey and followed very similar protocols
as the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC). Due to haul performance
issues and differences in sampling depths, the 1977 are omitted from
analysis.

Due to changes in survey timing, the Triennial Survey data have been
split into independent early (1980-1992) and late (1995-2004) survey
time series. The splitting of this time series was investigated during
the 2009 STAR panel due to the changes in survey timing and the expected
change in petrale sole catchability because of the stock's seasonal
onshore-offshore migrations (Cook et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-cook_petrale_2009}{2009}). For these reasons, as
well as because the split improved fits to the split time series and
made small changes to the estimation of the selectivity curves, the 2009
STAR panel supported the split.

The Triennial Survey commonly encounters petrale sole along the U.S West
Coast (Figure \ref{fig:tri_map}). The catch-per-unit-effort estimated
from the survey is roughly constant across the surveyed latitudes
(Figure \ref{fig:tri_cpue_lat}). Additionally, petrale sole were
captured across the survey depths between 55-500 m (Figure
\ref{fig:tri_cpue_depth}). The observed lengths captured across depths
by each survey period are shown in Figure \ref{fig:tri_size_depth}.

The data from the petrale sole was analyzed using a spatio-temporal
delta model implemented as an R package, VAST (Thorson and Barnett
\protect\hyperlink{ref-thorson_comparing_2017}{2017}, Thorson
\protect\hyperlink{ref-thorson_guidance_2019}{2019}), described above in
Section \ref{nwfsc-west-coast-groundfish-bottom-trawl-survey}. Spatial
variation was approximated using 250 knots, and the model used the
bias-correction algorithm (Thorson and Kristensen
\protect\hyperlink{ref-thorson_implementing_2016}{2016}) in Template
Model Builder (Kristensen et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-kristensen_tmb:_2016}{2016}). The index of
abundance was estimated using VAST seperately for the early and late
periods of the survey.

The gamma distribution with random strata-year and vessel effects was
chosen as the final model for both the early and late time periods. The
Q-Q plots do not show any departures from the assumed distribution
(Figures \ref{fig:tri_early_qq} and \ref{fig:tri_late_qq}). The Pearson
residuals for the encounter and catch rates for the early and late
periods are shown in Figures \ref{fig:tri_early_enc_rate},
\ref{fig:tri_early_catch_rate}, \ref{fig:tri_late_enc_rate}, and
\ref{fig:tri_late_catch_rate}.

The estimated index of abundance is given in Table
\ref{tab:Index_Summary}. For comparison, the 2013 model estimated, the
2019 design based, and the 2019 VAST indices are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:tri_index}. The estimated density of petrale sole is show in
Figures \ref{fig:tri_early_density} and \ref{fig:tri_late_density}. The
index for the Triennial Survey across the early and late period shows an
slight increase in the population between 1980 and 2001 with a spike in
the final year of 2004.

Length bins from 12 to 62 cm in 2 cm increments were used to summarize
the length frequency of the survey catches in each year. Table
\ref{tab:Triennial_Lengths} shows the number of lengths taken by the
survey. The length frequency distributions for the Triennial Survey from
1980-2004 are shown in Figures \ref{fig:tri_early_len_freq} and
\ref{fig:tri_late_len_freq}. The stratifications for length data
expansions are provided in Tables \ref{tab:strata_tri_early} and
\ref{tab:strata_tri_late}.

There are no petrale sole age data from the Triennial Survey.

The input sample sizes for length data were calculated using the same
approach for the NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey data
described in Section
\ref{nwfsc-west-coast-groundfish-bottom-trawl-survey}.

\subsection{Fishery-Dependent Data}\label{fishery-dependent-data}

\subsubsection{Commercial Fishery
Landings}\label{commercial-fishery-landings}

All landings for this update assessment were summarized by port of
landing, where available, as well as for a northern fleet consisting of
Washington and Oregon and a southern fleet consisting of California.
Landings for Washington and Oregon are summed into a single northern
fleet due to the fact that vessels commonly fish and land in each
other's waters and ports.

The PacFIN database (1981-2018 for California and Washington; 1987-2018
for Oregon) extracted June 26, 2019. Historical catches were not updated
from the previous assessment in 2013. The 2013 assessment historical
Washington catches were obtained from WDFW landings reconstruction for
1935, 1939 and 1949- 1969 (pers. comm. T. Tsou and G. Lippert) and the
Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission (PMFC) Data Series for 1956-1980
(PFMC \protect\hyperlink{ref-pfmc_data_1979}{1979}). The 2013 assessment
historical Oregon landings were obtained from reconstruction for 1932 to
1986 (Karnowski et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-karnowski_historical_2014}{2014}). The 2013
assessment historical California landings used catch reconstruction data
extending from 1931-1980 (Ralston et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ralston_documentation_2010}{2010}) and California
Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) Fish Bulletins for 1916-1930 landings
(Heimann and Carlisle
\protect\hyperlink{ref-heimann_pacific_1970}{1970}) as reconstructed by
Lai et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-lai_stock_2005}{2005}). The
California fishery began in 1876 but no landings data are available from
1876-1915. Therefore a linear interpolation between landings of 1 ton in
1876 and the landings recorded for 1916 are used to filling this period.

Landings for the fishing year, beginning on 1 November, are summarized
by fleet in Table \ref{tab:Comm_Catch} and Figure \ref{fig:Catch}. The
landings of petrale sole by gear types other than groundfish-trawl have
been inconsequential, averaging less than 2.5\% of the coast-wide
landings. The non-trawl landings, that consist of only a small fraction
of the total landings, are included in the trawl landings.

\subsubsection{Discards}\label{discards}

Data on discards of petrale sole are available from two different data
sources. The earliest source is referred to as the Pikitch data and
comes from a study organized by Ellen Pikitch that collected trawl
discards from 1985-1987 (Pikitch et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-pikitch_evaluation_1988}{1988}). The northern and
southern boundaries of the study were \(48^\circ 42^\prime\) N latitude
and \(42^\circ 60^\prime\) N latitude respectively, which is primarily
within the Columbia INPFC area (Pikitch et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-pikitch_evaluation_1988}{1988}, Rogers and
Pikitch \protect\hyperlink{ref-rogers_numerical_1992}{1992}).
Participation in the study was voluntary and included vessels using
bottom, midwater, and shrimp trawl gears. Observers of normal fishing
operations on commercial vessels collected the data, estimated the total
weight of the catch by tow, and recorded the weight of species retained
and discarded in the sample. Results of the Pikitch data were obtained
from John Wallace (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA) for the 2013
assessment in the form of ratios of discard weight to retained weight of
petrale sole and sex-specific length frequencies. The Pikitch discard
estimates were applied to both the summer and winter northern fisheries
and are shown in Table \ref{tab:Discard}. These data have not been
modified in this update assessment.

The second source is from the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program
(WCGOP). This program is part of the NWFSC and has been recording
discard observations since 2003. Table \ref{tab:Discard} shows the
discard ratios (discarded/(discarded + retained)) of petrale sole from
WCGOP based on observer observations. Since 2011, when the trawl
rationalization program was implemented, observer coverage rates
increased to nearly 100\% for all the limited entry trawl vessels in the
program and discard rates declined compared to pre-2011 rates. However,
discarding rate of petrale sole within this data-set has always been
relatively low. Discard rates were obtained for both the catch-share and
the non-catch share sector for petrale sole. A single discard rate was
calculated by weighting discard rates based on the commercial landings
by each sector. Coefficient of variations were calculated for the
non-catch shares sector and pre-catch share years by bootstrapping
vessels within ports because the observer program randomly chooses
vessels within ports to be observed. The coefficient of variation of
discarding in the catch share fleet, given nearly 100\% observer
coverage, was considered low and a value of 0.01 was assumed. The
discard rates from WCGOP are shown in Table \ref{tab:Discard}.

Starting in 2015, a small number of vessels switched to electronic
monitoring discards at sea rather than a human observer (4, 7, and 8
vessels in 2015, 2016, and 2017 respectively). Discarding rates at sea
of petrale sole by these vessels were very low, near zero. This update
assessment did not evaluate these data to estimate an electronic
monitoring specific discard rate, but rather applied the discard ratio
from the observed vessels in the WCGOP database. Future assessments
should evaluate this assumption in greater detail.

Discard mean body weight data were obtained from the WCGOP data and used
in this update assessment for each of the four fishing fleets. The mean
body weight of discarded fish from each fleet are shown in Figures
\ref{fig:nw_bodywt} - \ref{fig:ss_bodywt}. The summer fisheries, both
north and south, had relatively large sample numbers which is reflected
in a lower coefficient of variation by year relative to the winter
fisheries.

Discard length composition data available from the Pikitch study and
WCGOP data were used in this update assessment to estimate retention
curves for each of the four fishing fleets. The discard length data from
each fleet are shown in Figures \ref{fig:north_lengths} and
\ref{fig:south_lengths}.

\subsubsection{Foreign Landings}\label{foreign-landings}

The impact of landings of petrale sole by foreign fishing fleets prior
to the institution of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the U.S. West
Coast is currently not quantified and remains an area for research.

\subsubsection{Historical Commercial Catch-Per-Unit
Effort/Logbooks}\label{historical-commercial-catch-per-unit-effortlogbooks}

Commercial logbook data for petrale sole was first used to construct
CPUE indices of abundance in the 1999 assessment for Oregon fleets from
1987-1997 (Sampson and Lee
\protect\hyperlink{ref-sampson_assessment_1999}{1999}). Since the first
inclusion in 1999, the commercial CPUE indices were extended and or
updated based on management changes and new statistical methods through
2009. For additional information on the use of CPUE indices in the
assessment of petrale sole please see the 2013 assessment (Haltuch et
al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2013}{2013}\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2013}{b}).

CPUE calculations for the Winter fishery on aggregations of petrale sole
described in the 2013 assessment were retained for this assessment
(Haltuch et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2013}{2013}\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2013}{b})
(Figures \ref{fig:north_cpue} and \ref{fig:south_cpue}). Two CPUE
indices from 1987-2009 with catchability modeled as a power function are
used in this update assessment, one for the north and south winter
fisheries. These data have not been re-evaluated for this update
assessment.

\subsubsection{Fishery Length and Age
Data}\label{fishery-length-and-age-data}

The PacFIN BDS database contains data from Oregon Department of Fish and
Wildlife (ODFW; 1966-present) and Washington Department of Fish and
Wildlife (WDFW; 1955- present), but only 1986-present data from
California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG). The CDFG data set for the
years 1948-1992 was extracted and provided from CalCOM by Brenda Erwin
(CDFG) in 2011.

The historical Oregon data for petrale sole has change substantially
since 2015. The state has identified that all samples collected prior to
1987 were not collected according to the state's standardized sampling
protocol that were included in PacFIN as random samples in error (pers.
comm. Ali Whitman). These samples likely represent samples that were
collected for special projects. Oregon has removed some of these samples
for petrale sole from PacFIN, but not all, as of June 2019. To remove
the remaining non-standard samples, Oregon PacFIN data were filtered to
remove all samples prior to 1987. Although these samples were removed
from the length and age composition data for this update assessment,
future assessments should evaluate these data to determine if they can
be included within the assessment through alternative means (e.g.,
external estimates of length-at-age or as conditional-age-at-length
data).

Commercial length-frequency distributions based on the fishing year were
developed for each state for which observations were available. For each
fleet, the raw observations (compiled from the PacFIN and CalCOM
data-bases) were expanded to the sample level, to allow for any fish
that were not measured, then to the trip level to account for the
relative size of the landing from which the sample was obtained. The
expanded length observations were then expanded by the landings in each
state for the combined Washington and Oregon fleet. Age frequencies were
computed in the same manner, except that age observations for Washington
and Oregon were not combined due to ageing error considerations.

Length and age data collected from commercial landings for each fleet
are summarized by the number of trips and fish sampled by year (Tables
\ref{tab:Fishery_Lengths} and \ref{tab:Fishery_Ages}). Figures
\ref{fig:north_lengths}, \ref{fig:south_lengths}, and
\ref{fig:comm_ages} show plots of the commercial length and age
composition data across time for each fishery fleet.

The calculation for input sample sizes for the commercial length and age
data was done to be consistent with the 2013 assessment. The input
sample size for commercial lengths and ages were set equal to the number
of trips by year for each fleet.

\subsection{Biological Data}\label{biological-data}

\subsubsection{Natural Mortality}\label{natural-mortality}

The instantaneous rate of natural mortality for a wild fish population
is notoriously difficult to estimate. One accepted method is to examine
the age distribution of an unexploited or lightly exploited stock. This
method cannot readily be applied to petrale sole given the long history
of exploitation off the U.S. West Coast. Ketchen and Forrester
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-ketchen_population_1966}{1966}) estimated that
the natural mortality coefficients were 0.18-0.26 yr\textsuperscript{-1}
for males and 0.19-0.21 yr\textsuperscript{-1} for females based on a
catch curve analysis of 1943-1945 Washington trawl data from Swiftsure
Bank, off the southwest corner of Vancouver Island. However, petrale
sole catches were relatively high during mid-1940s through the 1950s.
Starr and Fargo (\protect\hyperlink{ref-starr_petrale_2004}{2004})
estimated the instantaneous rate of natural mortality (\(M\)) using
Hoenig's method (Hoenig
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hoenig_empirical_1983}{1983}) estimating \(M\)
values of 0.22 and 0.15 yr\textsuperscript{-1} were estimated given
maximum ages of 20 and 30 years, respectively.

An archived set of commercial samples, collected from Northern
California between the late 1950s and early 1980s, recently found that
multiple samples were aged between 20-31 years old, suggesting a similar
range of \(M\) values for U.S. West Coast petrale sole. U.S. stock
assessments prior to 2009 and current British Columbia stock assessments
assumed a value of \(M\) = 0.2 yr\textsuperscript{-1} for both sexes.
The 2013 stock assessment used a meta-analysis value produced the
following normal prior distributions for females (mean = 0.151, sd =
0.16) and males (0.206, sd = 0.218) based on early research by Owen
Hamel (pers. comm.) with maximum age for females and males of 32 and 29
years, respectively.

Hamel (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hamel_method_2015}{2015}) refined and
published a method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating the
\(M\) rate to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size,
growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior on \(M\). In
that same issue of \emph{ICES Journal of Marine Science}, Then et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-then_evaluating_2015}{2015}) provided an updated
data set of estimates of \(M\) and related life history parameters
across a large number of fish species from which to develop an \(M\)
estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by recommending
\(M\) estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an updated
Hoenig non-linear least squares estimator \(M=4.899A^{-0.916}_{max}\).
The approach of basing \(M\) priors on maximum age alone was one that
was already being used for West Coast rockfish assessments. However, in
fitting the alternative model forms relating \(M\) to
\(A_{\text{max}}\), Then et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-then_evaluating_2015}{2015}) did not
consistently apply their transformation. In particular, in real space,
one would expect substantial heteroscedasticity in both the observation
and process error associated with the observed relationship of \(M\) to
\(A_{\text{max}}\). Therefore, it would be reasonable to fit all models
under a log transformation. This was not done. Re-evaluating the data
used in Then et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-then_evaluating_2015}{2015})
by fitting the one-parameter \(A_{\text{max}}\) model under a log-log
transformation (such that the slope is forced to be -1 in the
transformed space (Hamel
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hamel_method_2015}{2015})), the point estimate
for \(M\) is:

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

The above is also the median of the prior. The prior is defined as a
lognormal distribution with mean \(ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})\) and SE =
0.438.

The natural mortality prior was updated for this update assessment using
the above approach (Figure \ref{fig:m_prior}). Maximum age was assumed
to be 32 and 29 years for females and males, respectively, the same
assumption applied in the 2013 assessment. Using the Hamel et al.
approach above, the prior value for females in regular space is 0.169
and for males is 0.186.

\subsubsection{Maturation and Fecundity}\label{maturation-and-fecundity}

Petrale sole maturity-at-length information is generally sparse in space
and time, has not been collected in a systematic fashion across time, is
of varying quality, and does not always agree between studies. It is
possible that maturity may have changed over time. However, it is not
possible to assess this quantitatively owing to differences in when
historical samples on which maturity ogives could be based were taken,
and how maturity stage (visual vs.~histological) was determined. The
2005 petrale sole assessment used the most recent study for the West
Coast of the U.S. that was based on observations collected during 2002
from Oregon and Washington (Hannah et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hannah_length_2002}{2002}). The 50\%
size-at-maturity was estimated at 33.1 cm with maturity asymptoting to
1.0 for larger fish (Figure \ref{fig:maturity}).

At the time of the last assessment, there had been limited information
regarding fecundity at age or length of petrale sole. The 2013 stock
assessment assumed that fecundity of female petrale sole was equal to
biomass (Figure \ref{fig:fecundity_model}). However, new research has
been done examining the fecundity of petrale sole (Lefebvre et al. n.d.)
which is in press at Fisheries Research. The study concluded a
difference in fecundity between California and Washington petrale sole
where a 40 cm fish in California is more fecund compared to northern
fish of the same size (Figure \ref{fig:fecundity}). However, northern
fish of the largest size were more fecund relative to fish in
California. The current petrale sole model is a single area coastwide
model, which assumes fish along the U.S. have the same biology
(e.g.~natural mortality, growth, fecundity). The estimates of fecundity
for petrale sole were considered new data and based on the guidelines
for update stock assessments, these data were not included in the base
model. However, a sensitivity to including these data was provided. The
next full assessment should explore and include the new data about
fecundity-at-length.

\subsubsection{Sex Ratio}\label{sex-ratio}

Past assessments of petrale sole have assumed a 50\% sex ratio between
females and males off the U.S West Coast. Similarly, Canadian data from
the 2004 published stock assessment also suggests sex ratios of petrale
sole in British Columbia are generally 50\% males and 50\% females
(Starr and Fargo \protect\hyperlink{ref-starr_petrale_2004}{2004}). To
be consistent with the full assessment this update assessment retains
the equal sex ratio assumption. However, examining the NWFSC West Coast
Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey data the proportion of females in the
population across the mid-range lengths is approximately 0.40 - 0.45
with the proportion increasing to 1 at the largest lengths due to
dimorphic growth (Figure \ref{fig:sex_ratio}). The next full assessment
should evaluate the sex ratio across time and space for petrale sole.

\subsubsection{Length-Weight
Relationship}\label{length-weight-relationship}

The length-weight relationship for petrale sole was estimated outside
the model using all biological data available from the NWFSC West Coast
Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey data consistent with method applied by
the 2013 assessment. The female weight-at-length in grams was estimated
at 1.986e-06\(L\)\textsuperscript{3.48} and males at
2.983e-06\(L\)\textsuperscript{3.36} where \(L\) is length in cm
(Figures \ref{fig:wt_length}). The length-weight relationship estimates
from the NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey data were
consistent with the biological observations available from the fishery
data.

\subsubsection{Growth (Length-at-Age)}\label{growth-length-at-age}

The length-at-age was estimated for male and female petrale sole. Figure
\ref{fig:length_age} shows the lengths and ages as well as predicted von
Bertalanffy fits to the data from the fishery and the NWFSC West Coast
Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey data. Females grow larger than males and
sex-specific growth parameters were estimated at the following values
for females \(L_{\infty}\) = 54 cm; \(k\) = 0.16 \(\text{yr}^{-1}\), and
males \(L_{\infty}\) = 41 cm; \(k\) = 0.25 \(\text{yr}^{-1}\). These
values were used as starting parameter values within the base model
prior to estimating each parameter for male and female petrale sole.

\subsubsection{Ageing Precision and
Bias}\label{ageing-precision-and-bias}

Historically, petrale sole otoliths have been read by multiple ageing
labs using surface and break and burn methods. In order to conduct a
comprehensive estimation of ageing bias and imprecision, the 2009
assessment compiled and analyzed all of the available double-read data
from the Cooperative Aging Project (CAP) and the Washington Department
of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), as well information from a bomb radiocarbon
age validation study for petrale sole off the U.S. West Coast (Haltuch
and Hicks \protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2009}{2009}, Haltuch et
al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_california_2013}{2013}\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_california_2013}{a})).

The 2013 stock assessment applied read method and lab specific ageing
error vectors (Haltuch et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2013}{2013}\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2013}{b}).
The same approach to ageing error based on data source are and reading
method was applied in this update stock assessment. The ageing error
vectors are shown in Tables \ref{tab:age_error1} and
\ref{tab:age_error2}. For a detailed description please see the 2013
stock assessment (Haltuch et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2013}{2013}\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2013}{b}).

\subsubsection{Environmental and Ecosystem
Data}\label{environmental-and-ecosystem-data}

This update assessment did not evaluate potential ecosystem data and
methodologies for petrale sole.

\section{Assessment Model}\label{assessment-model}

\subsection{History of Modeling Approaches Used for This
Stock}\label{history-of-modeling-approaches-used-for-this-stock}

Early stock assessments only assessed petrale sole in the combined
U.S.-Vancouver and Columbia INPFC areas, i.e.~petrale sole in these
areas were treated as a unit stock, using time series of data that began
during the 1970s (Demory
\protect\hyperlink{ref-demory_progress_1984}{1984}, Turnock et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-turnock_status_1993}{1993}). The first assessment
used stock reduction analysis and the second assessment used the
length-based Stock Synthesis model. The third petrale sole assessment
utilized the hybrid length-and-age-based Stock Synthesis 1 model, using
data from 1977-1998 (Sampson and Lee
\protect\hyperlink{ref-sampson_assessment_1999}{1999}). During the 1999
stock assessment an attempt was made to include separate area
assessments for the Eureka and Monterey INPFC areas but acceptable
models could not be configured due to a lack of data (Sampson and Lee
\protect\hyperlink{ref-sampson_assessment_1999}{1999}).

The 2005 petrale sole assessment was conducted as two separate stocks,
the northern stock encompassing the U.S. Vancouver and Columbia INPFC
areas and the southern stock including the Eureka, Monterey and
Conception INPFC areas, using Stock Synthesis 2, a length-age structured
model. Both the northern- and southern-area models specified the fishing
year as beginning on November 1 and continuing through October 31 of the
following year, with a November-February winter fishery and a
March-October summer fishery. Landings prior to 1957 were assumed to
have been taken during the summer season in years where monthly data
were not available to split the catches seasonally. The complete catch
history was reconstructed for petrale sole for the 2005 stock
assessment, with the northern area model starting in 1910 and the
southern area model in 1876. In 2005, the STAR panel noted that the
petrale sole stock trends were similar in both northern and southern
areas, in spite of the different modeling choices made for each area,
and that a single coast-wide assessment should be considered.

The 2009 and 2011 assessments treated petrale sole as a single
coast-wide stock, with the fleets and landings structured by state (WA,
OR, CA) area of catch. During the 2011 STAR panel concerns were raised
regarding the difficulty of discriminating landings from Washington and
Oregon waters, particularly in light of the Oregon historical landings
reconstruction that includes a summary of data by port of landing but
not by catch area, due to the fact that the Oregon and Washington
vessels commonly fish in each other's waters and land in each other's
ports. The availability of the historical comprehensive landings
reconstruction for Oregon by port of landing lead the STAR panel to
recommend combining the Washington and Oregon fleets within the
coast-wide stock assessment using port of landing rather than catch
area.

Starting with the 2013 stock assessment, the coast-wide stock assessment
now summarizes petrale sole landings by the port of landing and combines
Washington and Oregon into a single fleet (Haltuch et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2013}{2013}\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2013}{b}).
This update assessment assumes the same approach as the 2013 stock
assessment.

\subsection{General Model Specifications and
Assumptions}\label{general-model-specifications-and-assumptions}

Stock Synthesis version 3.30.03.13 was used to estimate the parameters
in the model (Methot and Wetzel
\protect\hyperlink{ref-methot_stock_2013}{2013}). r4ss, version 1.35.1,
along with R version 3.4.3 were used to investigate and plot model fits.
A summary of the data sources used in the model (details discussed
above) is shown in Figure \ref{fig:data_plot}.

\subsubsection{Changes Between the 2013, the 2015 Update, and the
Current Update Assessment
Model}\label{changes-between-the-2013-the-2015-update-and-the-current-update-assessment-model}

This update assessment model retains all parameterization assumed in the
2013 assessment. The only changes between the 2013 and this update
assessment were extending and reprocessing data sources. This section
linking the two models is intended to clearly identify where substantive
changes were made. These changes include:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Fitting using SS v.3.30.13.

\item Added commercial fishery catch data (2015-2018).

\item Added composition data from the commercial fishery (length and age data 2015-2018) and reprocessed all data and expanded based upon the current methods.

\item Added recent discard data (2014-2017) and reprocessed all discard rate, average weight, and length composition data.

\item Added 2015-2018 NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey  data and calculated the index of abundance using VAST.

\item Added NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey length and age data 2015-2018.

\item Triennial Survey early and late indices of abundance were calculated using VAST.

\item Model tuning to re-weight data. 

\item Length-weight relationship parameters estimated outside of the stock assessment model from the NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey data up to 2018 and input as fixed values.

\item Update the natural mortality prior for female and male fish.

\end{enumerate}

The general model set-up is described in Table \ref{tab:Model_setup}.

\subsubsection{Summary of Fleets and
Areas}\label{summary-of-fleets-and-areas}

Fishery removals were divided among 4 fleets: 1) Winter North trawl, 2)
Summer North trawl, 3) Winter South trawl, and 4) Summer South trawl.
Landings for the North fleet are defined as fish landed in Washington
and Oregon ports. Landings for the South fleet are defined as fish
landed in California ports. Removals by other gears are very small and
are included in the trawl fishery removals. The data available for each
fleet are described in Figure \ref{fig:data_plot}.

\subsubsection{Priors}\label{priors}

Priors were applied only to parameters for steepness (\(h\)) and natural
mortality (\(M\)). The steepness prior is based on the Myers
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-myers_maximum_1999}{1999}) meta-analysis of
flatfish steepness and the natural mortality prior is based on a
meta-analysis completed by Hamel
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hamel_method_2015}{2015}). The prior for
steepness assumed a beta distribution with a mean equal to 0.80 (Figure
\ref{fig:h_prior}).

The natural mortality prior was updated for this update assessment using
the Hamel meta-analysis approach. Maximum age was assumed to be 32 and
29 years for females and male, respectively (Figure \ref{fig:m_prior}).
The same maximum age assumption was applied in the 2013 assessment.

\subsubsection{Data Weighting}\label{data-weighting}

Length and conditional-age-at-length compositions from the NWFSC West
Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey were fit along with length and
marginal age compositions from the fishery fleets and the Triennial
Survey. Length data started with a input sample size determined from the
equation listed in Sections
\ref{nwfsc-west-coast-groundfish-bottom-trawl-survey} (survey data) and
\ref{fishery-length-and-age-data} (fishery data). It was assumed for
conditional-age-at-length data that each age was a random sample within
the length bin and the model started with a sample size equal to the
number of fish in that length bin.

The update assessment model was weighted using the McAllister and
Ianelli (\protect\hyperlink{ref-mcallister_bayesian_1997}{1997}) method
(Harmonic Mean weighting), consistent with the 2013 full and 2015 update
assessments. The McAllister and Ianelli data weight approach looks at
the difference between individual observations and predictions. A
sensitivity was performed examining the difference between alternative
weighting approaches. The weights applied to each length and age data
set for the base model are shown in Table \ref{tab:harm}.

\subsubsection{Estimated and Fixed
Parameters}\label{estimated-and-fixed-parameters}

There were 304 estimated parameters in the base model. These included
parameters for \(R_0\), natural mortality by sex, steepness, growth,
selectivity, retention, time blocking of the fleets and the surveys,
commercial CPUE catchability, recruitment deviations, and forecast
recruitment deviations (Table \ref{tab:model_params}).

Fixed parameters in the model were as follows. The standard deviation of
recruitment deviates was fixed at 0.40. Maturity-at-length and fecundity
was fixed as described above in Section \ref{maturation-and-fecundity}.
Length-weight parameters were fixed at estimates using all length-weight
observations (Figure \ref{fig:wt_length}).

\subsubsection{Key Assumptions and Structural
Choices}\label{key-assumptions-and-structural-choices}

All structural choices for stock assessment models are likely to be
important under some circumstances. In this update assessment update
these choices are generally made to be consistent with the previous
assessment (Haltuch et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2013}{2013}\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2013}{b}).
Major choices in the structuring of this stock assessment model include
a coast-wide model with seasonal fleet structure for two regions, north
and south, splitting the Triennial Survey into an early and late time
period, and estimates of selectivity and retention curves for each
fleet.

\subsubsection{Bridging Analysis}\label{bridging-analysis}

The exploration of models began by bridging from the 2015 update
assessment to Stock Synthesis version 3.30.03.13, which produced no
discernible difference (Figure \ref{fig:bridge}).

\subsubsection{Convergence}\label{convergence}

Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process
from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine
if the model found a better minimum. Starting parameters were jittered
by 5\% and 10\%. This was repeated 50 times and a better minimum was not
found (Table \ref{tab:jitter}). Jittering showed the model to be
sensitive to starting values and there were a number of times where the
model resulted in similar likelihood values (\textless{} 1 unit
difference) to the maximum likelihood estimate.

Through the jittering done as explained above and likelihood profiles,
we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best
fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties
in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability, although
much of the early model investigation was done without attempting to
estimate a Hessian.

\subsection{Base Model Results}\label{base-model-results}

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic
standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:model_params} and the
likelihood components are shown in Table \ref{tab:like}. Estimates of
derived reference points and approximate 95\% asymptotic confidence
intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts}. Estimates of stock size
over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:Timeseries_mod1}.

\subsubsection{Parameter Estimates}\label{parameter-estimates}

Natural mortality be sex was estimated directly within the model.
Natural mortality was estimated to be 0.159 for female fish and 0.164
for male fish. In comparison the estimates from the 2015 assessment were
0.145 and 0.154 for female and male fish, respectively.

Steepness was also estimated within the model, consistent with the
approach applied in the 2013 full and 2015 update assessment. The
estimate of steepness from the Beverton-Holt stock recruitment curve was
estimated at 0.84. The previous update assessment estimated a steepness
of 0.89.

The estimates of maximum length and the von Bertanlaffy growth
coefficient, \(k\), were less than the external estimates for males and
female but were well within the 95\% confidence interval given the
estimated uncertainty (Table \ref{tab:model_params}). The estimated
\(k\) for female and male fish were greater than the values estimated in
the 2015 update assessment (0.142 versus 0.134 for females and 0.238
versus 0.203 for males). The majority of growth for female and male
petrale sole growth occurs at younger ages, reaching near maximum length
by age 10-15, depending upon sex, with female petrale sole reaching
larger maximum lengths (Figure \ref{fig:sizeatage}). The spawning output
estimated was equal to the spawning weight of female fish (Figure
\ref{fig:spawnoutlen}).

Selectivity curves were estimated for the fishery and survey fleets. The
estimated selectivities for the fishery fleets are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:fish_selex}. All fishery selectivities were estimated to be
asymptotic, reaching maximum selectivity for fish between 35 and 40 cm.
Shifts in selectivities for were estimated for each fleet fishery were
estimated based on time blocks assumed in the 2013 assessment (Figure
\ref{fig:fish_selex}). The estimated retention curves for each fleet
based on the historical time blocks and discarded length composition
data are shown in Figure \ref{fig:fish_reten}. Sex specific survey
selectivities were assumed to be asymptotic and are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:survey_selex}.

The catchability for each of the winter CPUE time series were estimated
as power functions. The Winter North base catchability value was
estimated at 0.001 with the exponent parameter at -0.121. The Winter
South base catchability value was estimated at 0.26 with the exponent
parameter at -0.853.

The catchability for both surveys, Triennial Survey and NWFSC West Coast
Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey, were analytically solved comparing
observed to expected vulnerable biomass across all years. The Triennial
Survey had catchability values of 0.423 and 0.65 for the early and late
periods, respectively. The NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl
Survey catchability value 2.851.

Additional survey variability, process error added directly to each
year's input variability for the Triennial Survey, both early and late,
was estimated within the model. The model estimated an added variance of
0.218 for the early time period of and 0.313 for the late period. No
additional variance was estimated for the NWFSC West Coast Groundfish
Bottom Trawl Survey.

The time-series of estimated recruitments shows a relationship with the
decline in spawning output, punctuated by larger recruitments in recent
years (2006, 2007, and 2008) (Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and
\ref{fig:recdevs}). There is little information regarding recruitment
prior to 1960 and the uncertainty in those estimates is expressed in the
model. The five largest estimated recruitment estimated with the model
(in ascending order) occurred in 2006, 1998, 1966, 2007, and 2008. The
four lowest recruitments estimated within the model (in ascending order)
occurred in 1986, 1992, 1987, and 2003. However, recruitment in recent
years (2013 - 2017) is estimated to be less than the expected mean
recruitment indicating an absence of strong incoming recruitment. The
recruitment bias adjustment applied within the model across years is
shown in Figure \ref{fig:bias_adjust}.

\subsubsection{Fits to the Data}\label{fits-to-the-data}

There are numerous types of data for which the fits are discussed:
fishery CPUE, survey abundance indices, discard data (rates, mean body
weights, and length compositions), length-composition data for the
fisheries and surveys, marginal age compositions for the fisheries, and
conditional age-at-length observations for the NWFSC West Coast
Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey.

The fit to the CPUE for the winter fisheries is show in Figures
\ref{fig:fit_wn_cpue}, \ref{fig:q_north}, \ref{fig:fit_ws_cpue}, and
\ref{fig:q_south}. The model fits both of the CPUE time-series
relatively well. The fits to the survey indices are shown in Figures
\ref{fig:fit_tri_early}, \ref{fig:fit_tri_late}, and
\ref{fig:fit_nwfsc_survey}. In order to fit the early and the late
periods of the Triennial Survey extra standard error was required. The
trend in the early time-series of the Triennial Survey was generally not
consistent with other data within the model. The final year, 2004, in
the late period of the Triennial Survey was under fit by the model. The
petrale sole survey index from the NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom
Trawl Survey was generally fit well. However, the most recent year, 2018
data point which was lower than previous year's indices, was not fit by
the model.

The observed WCGOP discard rates (Figures \ref{fig:fit_wn_discard} -
\ref{fig:fit_ss_discard}) were fit by each fishery using time blocks.
The time blocks on the discard data was based on those define in the
2013 assessment (Haltuch et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_california_2013}{2013}\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_california_2013}{a})
with the final block starting in 2011 being extended through the final
model year, 2018. The discarding rates over time by each fleet are shown
in Figure \ref{fig:Discard}. The discard rates for the northern fleets
from the Pikitch data collected in 1985-1987 fit the mean of the
estimates for the winter fishery (Figure \ref{fig:fit_wn_discard}) but
estimated higher discard rates for the summer fleet (Figure
\ref{fig:fit_sn_discard}). The lack of fit to the summer fleet is
consistent to the estimates from the 2015 update assessment. Fits to the
WCGOP observed mean body weights are shown in Figures
\ref{fig:nw_bodywt_fit} - \ref{fig:ss_bodywt_fit}. The fits to the
discard mean body weights to the summer fleets were generally better
than the data from the winter fisheries which had more variable
observations and lower number of observations (hence larger annual
uncertainties).

Fits to the length data are shown based on the proportions of lengths
observed by year and the Pearson residuals-at-length for all fleets.
Detailed fits to the length data by year and fleet are provided in
Appendix A, Section
\ref{appendix-a.-detailed-fit-to-length-composition-data}. Aggregate
fits by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:length_agg}. There are a few
things that stand out when examining the aggregated length composition
data. First, the sexed discard lengths from the Pikitch study appear to
be poorly fit by the model but this is related to small sample sizes.
However, the unsexed discard lengths from the WCGOP data for each fleet
were fit well by the model.

Discard lengths from WCGOP were fit well by the model and show no
obvious pattern in the residuals (Figures
\ref{fig:discard_wn_len_pearson} - \ref{fig:discard_ss_len_pearson}).
The residuals to the fishery lengths clearly showed the growth
differential between males and females where the majority of positive
residuals at larger sizes were from female fish (Figures
\ref{fig:wn_len_pearson} - \ref{fig:ss_len_pearson}). Notably, the
Summer North fishery has a large positive residual pattern for male fish
between 1966-1980. A similar pattern in the Pearson residuals was
observed in the 2013 full and the 2015 update assessment (Haltuch et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2013}{2013}\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2013}{b},
Stawitz et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-stawitz_stock_2015}{2015}). The
residuals for each of the surveys are shown in Figures
\ref{fig:tri_early_len_pearson}, \ref{fig:tri_late_len_pearson}, and
\ref{fig:nwfsc_combo_len_pearson}. The Pearson residuals from the NWFSC
West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey shows indications of the 2008
cohort moving through the population. Length data were weighted
according to the McAllister Ianelli Harmonic approach and the data
weights are shown in Table \ref{tab:harm}.

Age data were fitted to as marginal age compositions for the fishery
fleets.The NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey ages were
treated as conditional age-at-length data to facilitate the estimation
of growth within the model. The aggregated fits to the marginal age data
are shown in Figure \ref{fig:age_agg}. The aggregated age data were
general fit well for the fishery fleets, however, the peaks of the age
data were often under fit by the model which was also observed in the
2013 assessment (Haltuch et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2013}{2013}\protect\hyperlink{ref-haltuch_status_2013}{b}).
Detailed fits to the age data by year and fleet are provided in Appendix
B, Section \ref{appendix-b.-detailed-fit-to-age-composition-data}. The
Pearson residuals for the fishery fleets are shown in Figures
\ref{fig:wn_age_pearson} - \ref{fig:ss_age_pearson}. The age data were
weighted using the McAllister Ianelli approach and the data weights are
shown in Table \ref{tab:harm}.

The observed and expected conditional age-at-length fits for NWFSC West
Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey are shown in Figures
\ref{fig:nwfsc_combo_andre_1} - \ref{fig:nwfsc_combo_andre_5}. The fits
generally match the observations. The Pearson residuals are shown in
Figure \ref{fig:nwfsc_combo_pearson_1} and
\ref{fig:nwfsc_combo_pearson_2}. The age data were also weighted
according to the McAllister Ianelli Harmonic mean weights (Table
\ref{tab:harm}).

\subsubsection{Population Trajectory}\label{population-trajectory}

The predicted spawning biomass is given in Table
\ref{tab:Timeseries_mod1} and plotted in Figure \ref{fig:ssb}. The
predicted spawning biomass time series shows a strong decline from the
late-1930s through the mid-1960s, followed by a small recovery through
the mid-1970s, and another decline to its lowest point during the early
1990s. This general pattern of stock decline is coincident with
increasing catches and the movement of the fishery from the south to the
north, and from summer fishing in shallow waters to winter fishing on
spawning aggregations in deeper waters. From the mid-1990s through 2005
the stock increased slightly, then declined through 2010 (Figure
\ref{fig:ssb}). The stock has increased strongly since 2010 in response
to reduced catches and above average recruitment in 2006, 2007, and
2008. The estimated total biomass follows the same general trend as
observed in the spawning biomass (Figure \ref{fig:total_bio}). The 2019
estimated spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning
biomass is above the target of 25\% of unfished spawning biomass at
39.1\% (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). Approximate confidence intervals based
on the asymptotic variance estimates show that the uncertainty in the
estimated spawning biomass is generally low. The standard deviation of
the log of the spawning output in 2019 is 0.09.

Recruitment deviations were estimated for the entire time-series that
was modeled (Figure \ref{fig:recruits} and discussed in Section
\ref{parameter-estimates}) and provide a realistic portrayal of
uncertainty. The time series of estimated recruitments shows a
relationship with the decline in spawning output, punctuated by larger
recruitments in 2006, 2007, and 2008. The five largest estimated
recruitment estimated with the model (in ascending order) occurred in
2006, 1998, 1966, 2007, and 2008. The four lowest recruitments estimated
within the model (in ascending order) occurred in 1986, 1992, 1987, and
2003. However, in recent years, 2013 - 2016, based on the data the
incoming recruitment has been estimated to be lower than average with
negative recruitment deviations (ranging between -0.10 and -0.33)
indicating an absence of strong incoming recruitment.

The stock-recruit curve resulting from a value of estimated steepness,
0.84, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:stock_recruit_curve} with estimated
recruitments also shown.

\subsubsection{Sensitivity Analyses}\label{sensitivity-analyses}

A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted. Each of the
sensitivities conducted was a single exploration from the base model
assumptions and/or data, and were not performed in a cumulative fashion.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Fix natural mortality value for female fish at a lower value of 0.125.
  
  \item Fix natural mortality value for female fish at a higher value of 0.180.
  
  \item Use the natural mortality prior for female and male fish used in the 2015 update assessment, natural mortality estimated for both sexes.
  
  \item Use the coastwide fecundity relationship for petrale sole estimated by Lefebvre et al. in press.
  
  \item Estimate the sex ratio between female and male fish within the model. Single parameter estimated for the modeled years.  Future explorations may want to explore blocking of this parameter for pre- and post-development of the spawning ground Winter fishery with the assumption that this may disproportionately impact the numbers of female petrale sole.
  
  \item Estimate the sex ratio between female and male fish within the model and assume the coastwide fecundity relationship for petrale sole based on Lefebvre et al. in press. Single parameter for the sex ratio estimated across all modeled years. 
  
  \item Data weighting according to the Francis method using the weighting values shown in Table \ref{tab:francis}. 
  
  \item Data weighting according to the Dirichlet method where the estimated parameters are shown in Table \ref{tab:dirichlet}. 
  
\end{enumerate}

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters from each sensitivity
are available in Table \ref{tab:sens_table}. Plots of the estimated
time-series of spawning biomass and relative spawning biomass are shown
in Figures \ref{fig:sens_ssb} and \ref{fig:sens_depl}.

The two sensitivities exploring higher and lower natural mortality for
female petrale sole were the two sensitivities that differed the most
from the base model. The estimated spawning biomasses and relative stock
statuses were higher or lower compared to the base model for each of
these runs (Table \ref{tab:sens_table}, Figures \ref{fig:sens_ssb} and
\ref{fig:sens_depl}).

Two sensitivities exploring alternative data weighting approaches were
compared to the base model which was weighted using the
McAllister-Ianelli data weighting approach. Both data weighting
approaches resulted in similar estimates to the base model (Table
\ref{tab:francis} and Figures \ref{fig:sens_ssb} and
\ref{fig:sens_ssb}). However, the Dirichlet data weighting approach
which estimates a parameter for each data source (e.g., length by fleet
and ages by fleet), the estimated parameters hit the upper bounds for
each data source (Table \ref{tab:dirichlet}). Converted to real space,
this data weighting approach resulted in full weight (approximately 1)
for each data set. The Dirichlet method is restricted to data weights
less than one, but both the Francis and McAllister and Ianelli
approaches estimated data weights greater than one for some data sets.
The estimated data weights are linked to the calculation of the input
sample sizes which in this model were calculated based on the number of
trips for the commercial data and a combination on number of tows and
fish samples for the surveys. Future work should be done to better
understand the performance of data weighting approaches dependent upon
the calculation of input sample sizes.

The final sensitivities that had potentially meaningful differences from
the base model were the three runs that explored a skewed sex ratio,
potential changes in the fecundity relationship for female petrale sole,
and both of these items combined. Each of these sensitivities resulted
in slightly more pessimistic estimates of the relative spawning biomass
(Table \ref{tab:sens_table}). It would be expected that the next full
assessment would explore both of these parameter changes.

\subsubsection{Retrospective Analysis}\label{retrospective-analysis}

A five-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model
using data only through 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 (Figures
\ref{fig:retro_ssb}, \ref{fig:retro_depl}, and \ref{fig:retro_recdev}).
The initial scale of the spawning biomass trended upward relative to the
base model. Overall, no alarming patterns were present in the
retrospective analysis.

\subsubsection{Added Data Analysis}\label{added-data-analysis}

The changes from the 2015 update assessment based on the addition and
reprocessing of data was explored. Each data source was added starting
with catches and ending with ages for all fleets within the model where
each model run contains the earlier updated data (e.g., + Lengths has
data through 2019 for the catches, indices, discard rates and weights,
and lengths for all fleets with only the age data through 2014). The
estimates of the spawning biomass, relative spawning biomass, and the
annual recruitment deviations from each model are shown in Figures
\ref{fig:ssb_data}, \ref{fig:depl_data}, and \ref{fig:recdev_data}.

The time-series when data was added was relatively similar to the
estimates from the 2015 update assessment. The one notable difference is
the estimates of spawning biomass between the 1950s and 1970s. This
update assessment estimates marginally larger spawning biomasses during
this period relative to the 2015 estimate. The source of this change was
due to two changes; 1) the removal of non-random samples from Oregon
from the commercial biological data contained in PacFIN (see Section
\ref{fishery-length-and-age-data} for additional information), and 2)
improvements in the processing and expansion of PacFIN data.

\subsubsection{Historical Analysis}\label{historical-analysis}

The estimated summary biomass from previous assessments since 2005 are
shown in Figure \ref{fig:historical_analysis}. The current assessment
estimated a slight increase in initial spawning biomass compared to
previous assessments.

\subsubsection{Likelihood Profiles}\label{likelihood-profiles}

Likelihood profiles were conducted for \(R_0\), steepness, and female
natural mortality values separately. These likelihood profiles were
conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimated the
remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value.

For steepness, the negative log-likelihood supported values between 0.70
- 0.95 (Figure \ref{fig:piner_h}). Likelihood components by data source
show that the age data (primarily the Northern fleets) support a higher
steepness value while the length data from the NWFSC West Coast
Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey support lower values. The surveys
generally provide very little information concerning steepness. The
relative spawning biomass for petrale sole diverges most during the
middle of the time series based on the assumed values of steepness with
the final status being above the management target biomass (Figures
\ref{fig:h_ssb_trajectory} and \ref{fig:h_depl_trajectory}).

The negative log-likelihood was minimized at a female natural mortality
value of 0.159, but the 95\% confidence interval extends over values
ranging from 0.12 - 0.18. Male natural mortality was estimated in the
likelihood profile. The age and length data likelihood contribution was
minimized at female natural morality values ranging from 0.15-0.16
(Figure \ref{fig:m_like}). The relative spawning biomass for petrale
sole widely varied across alternative values of natural mortality
(Figures \ref{fig:m_ssb_trajectory} and \ref{fig:m_depl_trajectory}).

In regards to values of \(R_0\), the negative log-likelihood was
minimized at approximately log(\(R_0\)) of 9.92 (Figure
\ref{fig:piner_R0}). The data source with the largest information
regarding \(R_0\) was the NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl
Survey.

\subsubsection{Reference Points}\label{reference-points-1}

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and
catch distributions among fleets in the most recent year of the model
(2018). Sustainable total yields (landings plus discards) were 3,135.2
mt when using an \(SPR_{30\%}\) reference harvest rate and with a 95\%
confidence interval of 2,849.4 mt based on estimates of uncertainty. The
spawning biomass equivalent to 25\% of the unfished spawning output
(\(SB_{25\%}\)) was 8,351.5.

The predicted spawning biomass from the base model generally showed a
decline beginning during the 1950s and reaching a low in spawning
biomass in 1993 with the stock declining to 5.8\% relative stock size
(Figures \ref{fig:ssb} and \ref{fig:depl}). Since 2010, the spawning
biomass has been increasing due to small catches and above average
recruitment. The 2019 spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium
spawning biomass is above the target of 25\% of unfished (Figure
\ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity, 1-SPR, exceeded the current
harvest rate limit (\(SPR_{30\%}\)) throughout the late 1970s until
approximately 2010 as seen in Figure \ref{fig:SPR_all_fig}. Recent
exploitation rates on petrale sole were estimated to be less than target
levels.

Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts} shows the full suite of estimated reference
points for the base model and Figure \ref{fig:yield} shows the
equilibrium curve based on a steepness value estimated at 0.84.

\section{Harvest Projections and Decision
Tables}\label{harvest-projections-and-decision-tables}

The forecast of stock abundance and yield was developed using the base
model. The total catches in 2019 and 2020 are set at values provided by
the Groundfish Management Team (GMT) of the PFMC at 2908 and 2845 mt,
respectively. The management adopted ACL values for these years are 2921
and 2857 mt. The exploitation rate for 2021 and beyond is based upon an
SPR of 30\% and the 25:5 harvest control rule. The average exploitation
rates, across recent years, by fleet as provided by the GMT were used to
distribute catches during the forecast period.

Uncertainty in the forecasts is based upon the three states of nature
based on the likelihood profile of female natural mortality (\(M\)),
chosen using a change of 1.2 NLL units (75\% interval) from the minimum
value to correspond to the midpoints of the lower 25\% probability and
upper 25\% probability regions from the base model and are low (0.130
yr\textsuperscript{-1}) and high (0.185 yr\textsuperscript{-1}) values
for female natural mortality.

Catches during the projection period under the current harvest control
rule are projected to start at 4115 mt and decline over the projection
period to 3093 mt, in the base model, as the stock declines towards that
target spawning biomass (Table \ref{tab:OFL_projection_back}). Across
the low and high states of nature the under the current harvest control
rule, the relative biomass (depletion) ranged between 0.24 - 0.34 by the
end of the 12-year projection period (Table
\ref{tab:Decision_table_mod1}).

\section{Regional Management
Considerations}\label{regional-management-considerations}

Currently petrale sole are managed using a coast-wide harvest; therefore
this assessment does not provide a recommended method for allocating
harvests regionally. The resource is modeled as a single stock. There is
currently no genetic evidence that there are distinct biological stocks
of petrale sole off the U.S. coast and the limited tagging data that
describes adult movement suggests that movement may be significant
across depth and latitude.

\section{Research Needs}\label{research-needs}

There are many areas of research that could be improved to benefit the
understanding and assessment of petrale sole. Below, are issues that are
considered of importance.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Due to limited data, new studies on maturity  for petrale sole would be beneficial.

\item Studies on stock structure and movement of petrale sole, particularly with regard to the winter-summer spawning migration of petrale sole and the likely trans-boundary movement of petrale sole between U.S. and Canadian waters seasonally.

\item The extent of spatial variability on productivity processes such as growth, recruitment, and maturity is currently unknown and would benefit from further research.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Acknowledgments}\label{acknowledgments}

Many people were instrumental in the successful completion of this
assessment and their contribution is greatly appreciated. This
assessment draws heavily on the text and analyses from previous petrale
sole assessments and has benefited greatly from the efforts of all
authors contributing to those analyses.

Alison Whitman (ODFW), Patrick Mirrick (ODFW), and Ted Calavan (ODFW)
provided Oregon composition data, historical catches, corrected PacFIN
catches, and quickly uploaded age data that were critical to this
assessment. Melissa Mandrup (CDFW) and Brenda Erwin (CDFW) provided
timely answers and resolutions regarding California data. John Wallace
provided multiple last minute PacFIN extractions and analyzed historical
discard rates for use in the assessment.

I am very grateful to Patrick McDonald and the team of agers at CAP for
their hard work reading numerous otoliths and availability to answer
questions when needed. Additionally, I am appreciative of agers at WDFW
who went above and beyond helping read the backlog of survey otoliths in
time for this assessment. The work by Todd Hay and Beth Horness to
streamline data access made data extraction and exploration easy. They
were always eager to help and answered numerous questions. Jason Jannot,
Kate Richardson, and Kayleigh Sommers assisted with data from the WCGOP
and entertained my many questions. Also, I would like to acknowledge our
survey team and their dedication to improving the assessments we do. The
data they collect is essential to assessment of West Coast stocks.

The assessment was greatly improved through the streamlining of data
processing tools (Kelli Johnson, Ian Taylor, Andi Stephens) and the many
discussions within the Population Ecology team in the FRAM division at
the NWFSC.

John Devore was an indispensable resource of the past, current, and
future management as well as a great organizer and representative of the
Pacific Fishery Management Council.
