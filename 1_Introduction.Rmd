#Introduction
  
##Basic Information
`r spp.up` (\emph{`r spp.sci`}) is a right-eyed flounder in the family Pleuronectidae ranging from the western Gulf of Alaska to the Coronado Islands, northern Baja California, (Hart 1973; Kramer et al. 1995; Love et al. 2005) with a preference for soft substrates at depths ranging from 0-550 m (Love et al. 2005). Common names include brill, California sole, Jordan's flounder, cape sole, round nose sole, English sole, soglia, petorau, nameta, and tsubame garei (Smith 1937; Hart 1973; Gates and Frey 1974; Love 1996; Eschmeyer and Herald 1983). In northern and central California `r spp` are dominant on the middle and outer continental shelf (Allen et al. 2006). PacFIN fishery logbook data show that adults are caught in depths from 18 to 1,280 m off the U.S. West Coast with a majority of the catches of `r spp` being taken between 70-220 m during March through October, and between 290-440 m during November through February.

There is little information regarding the stock structure of `r spp` off the U.S. Pacific coast. No genetic research has been undertaken for `r spp` and there is no other published research indicating separate stocks of `r spp` within U.S. waters. Tagging studies show adult `r spp` can move up to 350 - 390 miles, having the ability to be highly migratory with the possibility for homing ability (Alverson 1957; MBC Appl. Environ. Sci. 1987). Juveniles show little coast-wide or bathymetric movement while studies suggest that adults generally move inshore and northward onto the continental shelf during the spring and summer to feeding grounds and offshore and southward during the fall and winter to deep water spawning grounds (Hart 1973; MBC Appl. Environ. Sci. 1987; Horton 1989; Love 1996). Adult `r spp` can tolerate a wide range of bottom temperatures (Perry et al., 1994).

Tagging studies indicate some mixing of adults between different spawning groups. DiDonato and Pasquale (1970) reported that five fish tagged on the Willapa Deep grounds during the spawning season were recaptured during subsequent spawning seasons at other deepwater spawning grounds, as far south as Eureka (northern California) and the Umpqua River (southern Oregon). However, Pederson (1975) reported that most of the fish (97%) recaptured from spawning grounds in winter were originally caught and tagged on those same grounds.

Mixing of fish from multiple deep water spawning grounds likely occurs during the spring and summer when `r spp` are feeding on the continental shelf. Fish that were captured, tagged, and released off the northWest Coast of Washington during May and September were subsequently recaptured during winter from spawning grounds off Vancouver Island (British Columbia, 1 fish), Heceta Bank (central Oregon, 2 fish), Eureka (northern California, 2 fish), and Halfmoon Bay (central California, 2 fish) (Pederson, 1975). Fish tagged south of Fort Bragg (central California) during July 1964 were later recaptured off Oregon (11 fish), Washington (6 fish), and Swiftsure Bank (southwestern tip of Vancouver Island, 1 fish) (D. Thomas, California Department of Fish and Game, Menlo Park, CA, cited by Sampson and Lee, 1999).

The highest densities of spawning adults off of British Columbia, as well as of eggs, larvae and juveniles, are found in the waters around Vancouver Island. Adults may utilize nearshore areas as summer feeding grounds and non-migrating adults may stay there during winter (Starr and Fargo, 2004).

Past assessments completed by Demory (1984), Turnock et al. (1993), and Sampson and Lee (1999) considered `r spp` in the Columbia and U.S.-Vancouver INPFC areas a single stock. Sampson and Lee (1999) assumed that `r spp` in the Eureka and Monterey INPFC areas represented two additional distinct socks. The 2005 `r spp` assessment assumed two stocks, northern (U.S.-Vancouver and Columbia INPFC areas) and southern (Eureka, Monterey and Conception INPFC areas), to maintain
continuity with previous assessments. Three stocks (West Coast Vancouver Island, Queen Charlotte Sound, and Heceta Strait) are considered for `r spp` in the waters off British Columbia, Canada (Starr and Fargo, 2004). The 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015 assessments integrate the previously separate north-south assessments to provide a coast-wide status evaluation. The decision to conduct a single-area assessment is based on strong evidence of a mixed stock from tagging studies, a lack of genetic studies on stock structure, and a lack of evidence for differences in growth between the 2005 northern and southern assessment areas and from examination of the fishery size-at-age data, as well as confounding differences in data collection between Washington, Oregon, and California. This 2015 assessment provides a coast-wide status evaluation for `r spp` using data through 2014.

Fishing fleets are separated both geographically and seasonally to account for spatial and seasonal patterns in catch given the coast-wide assessment area. The `r spp` fisheries possess a distinct seasonality, with catches peaking during the winter months, so the fisheries are divided into winter (November-February) and summer (March-October) fisheries (Figure 2). Note that the "fishing year" for this assessment (November 1 to October 31) differs from the standard calendar year. The U.S.-Canadian border is the northern boundary for the assessed stock, although the basis for this choice is due to political and current management needs rather than the population dynamics. Given the lack of clear information regarding the status of distinct biological populations, this assessment treats the U.S. `r spp.up` resource from the Mexican border to the Canadian border as a single coast-wide stock.


##Life History
`r spp.up` spawn during the winter at several discrete deepwater sites (270-460 m) off the U.S. West Coast, from November to April, with peak spawning taking place from December to February (Harry 1959; Best 1960; Gregory and Jow 1976; Castillo et al. 1993; Carison and Miller 1982; Reilly et al. 1994; Castillo 1995; Love 1996; Moser 1996a; Casillas et al. 1998). Females spawn once each year and fecundity varies with fish size, with one large female laying as many as 1.5 million eggs (Porter, 1964). `r spp.up` eggs are planktonic, ranging in size from 1.2 to 1.3 mm, and are found in deep water habitats at water temperatures of 4-10 degrees C and salinities of 25-30 ppt (Best 1960; Ketchen and Forrester, 1966; Alderdice and Forrester 1971; Gregory and Jow 1976). The duration of the egg stage can range from approximately 6 to 14 days (Alderdice and Forrester 1971; Hart 1973; Love 1996, Casillas et al. 1998). The most favorable conditions for egg incubation and larval growth are 6-7 degrees C and 27.5-29.5 ppt (Ketchen and Forrester, 1966; Alderdice and Forrester, 1971; Castillo et al., 1995). Predators of `r spp` eggs include planktonic invertebrates and pelagic fishes (Casillas et al. 1998).

Females spawn once each year and fecundity varies with fish size, with one large female laying as many as 1.5 million eggs (Porter, 1964). `r spp.up` eggs are planktonic, ranging in size from 1.2 to 1.3 mm, and are found in deep water habitats at water temperatures of 4-10 degrees C and salinities of 25-30 ppt (Best 1960; Ketchen and Forrester, 1966; Alderdice and Forrester 1971; Gregory and Jow 1976). The duration of the egg stage can range from approximately 6 to 14 days (Alderdice and Forrester 1971; Hart 1973; Love 1996, Casillas et al. 1998). The most favorable conditions for egg incubation and larval growth are 6-7 degrees C and 27.5-29.5 ppt (Ketchen and Forrester, 1966; Alderdice and Forrester, 1971; Castillo et al., 1995). Predators of `r spp` eggs include planktonic invertebrates and pelagic fishes (Casillas et al. 1998).

Adult `r spp` achieve a maximum size of around 50 cm and 63 cm for males and females, respectively (Best 1963; Pedersen 1975). The maximum length reported for `r spp` is 70 cm (Hart 1973; Eschmeyer and Herald 1983; Love et al. 2005) while the maximum observed break-and-burn age is 31 years (Haltuch et al. 2013).

##Ecosystem Considerations
`r spp.up` juveniles are carnivorous, foraging on annelid worms, clams, brittle star, mysids, sculpin, amphipods, and other juvenile flatfish (Ford 1965; Casillas et al. 1998; Pearsall and Fargo 2007). Predators on juvenile `r spp` include adult `r spp` as well as other larger fish (Ford 1965; Casillas et al. 1998) while adults are preyed upon by marine mammals, sharks, and larger fishes (Trumble 1995; Love 1996; Casillas et al. 1998).

One of the ambushing flatfishes, adult `r spp` have diverse diets that become more piscivorous at larger sizes (Allen et al. 2006). Adult `r spp` are found on sandy and sand-mud bottoms (Eschmeyer and Herald 1983) foraging for a variety of invertebrates including, crab, octopi, squid, euphausiids, and shrimp, as well as anchovies. hake, herring, sand lance, and other smaller rockfish and flatfish (Ford 1965; Hart 1973; Kravitz et al. 1977; Birtwell et al. 1984; Reilly et al. 1994; Love 1996; Pearsall and Fargo 2007). In Canadian waters evidence suggests that `r spp` tend to prefer herring (Pearsall and Fargo 2007). On the continental shelf `r spp` generally co-occur with English sole, rex sole, Pacific sanddab, and rock sole (Kravitz et al. 1977).

Ecosystem factors have not been explicitly modeled in this assessment, but there are several aspects of the California current ecosystem that may impact `r spp` population dynamics and warrant further research. Castillo (1992) and Castillo et al. (1995) suggest that density-independent survival of early life stages is low and show that offshore Ekman transportation of eggs and larvae may be an important source of variation in year-class strength in the Columbia INPFC area. The effects of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) on California current temperature and productivity (Mantua et al. 1997) may also contribute to non-stationary recruitment dynamics for `r spp`. The prevalence of a strong late 1990s year-class for many West Coast groundfish species suggests that environmentally driven recruitment variation may be correlated among species with relatively diverse life history strategies. Although current research efforts along these lines are limited, a more explicit exploration of ecosystem processes may be possible in future `r spp` stock assessments.

##Historical and Current Fishery Information
`r spp.up` have been caught in the flatfish fishery off the U.S. Pacific coast since the late 19th century. The fishery first developed off of California where, prior to 1876, fishing in San Francisco Bay was by hand or set lines and beach seining (Scofield 1948). By 1880 two San Francisco based trawler companies were running a total of six boats, extending the fishing grounds beyond the Golden Gate Bridge northward to Point Reyes (Scofield 1948). Steam trawlers entered the fishery during 1888 and 1889, and four steam tugs based out of San Francisco were sufficient to flood market with flatfish (Scofield 1948). By 1915 San Francisco and Santa Cruz trawlers were operating at depths of about 45-100 m with catches averaging 10,000 lbs per tow or 3,000 lbs per hour (Scofield 1948). Flatfish comprised approximately 90% of the catch with 20-25% being discarded as unmarketable (Scofield 1948). During 1915 laws were enacted that prohibited dragging in California waters and making it illegal to possess a trawl net from Santa Barbara County southward (Scofield 1948). By 1934 twenty 56-72 foot diesel engine trawlers operated out of San Francisco fishing between about 55 and 185 m (Scofield 1948). From 1944-1947 the number of California trawlers fluctuated between 16 and 46 boats (Scofield 1948). Although the flatfish fishery in California was well developed by the 1950s and 1960s, catch statistics were not reported until 1970 (Heimann and Carlisle 1970). In this early California report `r spp` landings during 1916 to 1930 were not separated from the total flatfish landings. 

The earliest trawl fishing off Oregon began during 1884-1885, and the fishery was solidly established by 1937, with the fishery increasing rapidly during WWII (Harry and Morgan, 1961). Initially trawlers stayed close to the fishing grounds adjacent to Newport and Astoria, operating at about 35-90 m between Stonewall Bank and Depoe Bay. Fishing operations gradually extended into deep water. For example, Newport-based trawlers were commonly fishing at about 185 m in 1949, at about 185-365 m by 1952, and at about 550 m by 1953.

Alverson and Chatwin (1957) describe the history of the `r spp` fishery off of Washington and British Columbia with fishing grounds ranging from Cape Flattery to Destruction Island. `r spp.up` catches off of Washington were small until the late 1930s with the fishery extending to about 365 m following the development of deepwater rockfish fisheries during the 1950s.

By the 1950s the `r spp` fishery was showing signs of depletion with reports suggesting that `r spp` abundance had declined by at least 50% from 1942 to 1947 (Harry 1956). Sampson and Lee (1999) reported that three fishery regulations were implemented during 1957-67: 1) a winter closure off Oregon, Washington and British Columbia, 2) a 3,000 lb per trip limit, and 3) no more than two trips per month during 1957. With the 1977 enactment of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MFCMA) the large foreign-dominated fishery that had developed since the late 1960s was replaced by the domestic fishery that continues today. `r spp.up` are harvested almost exclusively by bottom trawls in the U.S. West Coast groundfish fishery. Recent `r spp` catches exhibit marked seasonal variation, with substantial portions of the annual harvest taken from the spawning grounds during December and January. Evidence suggests that the winter fishery on the deepwater spawning grounds developed sporadically during the 1950s and 1960s as fishers discovered new locations (e.g., Alverson and Chatwin, 1957; Ketchen and Forrester, 1966). Both historical and current `r spp` fisheries have primarily relied upon trawl fleets. Fishery removals were divided among 4 fleets: 1) winter North trawl, 2) summer North trawl, 3) winter South trawl, and 4) summer South trawl. Landings for the North fleet are defined as fish landed in Washington and Oregon ports. Landings for the South fleet are defined as fish landed in California ports.

Historical landings reconstructions show peak catches from the summer fishery occurred during the 1940s and 1950s and subsequently declined, during which time the fleet moved to fishing in deeper waters during the winter. After the period of peak landings during the 1940s and 1950s, total landings were somewhat stable until about the late 1970s, and then generally declined until the mid-2000s. (Table \ref{tab:Comm_Catch}, Figure \ref{fig:Catch}). During 2009 the fishery was declared overfished and during 2010 management restrictions limited the catch to `r prettyNum(as.numeric(round(Tot.catch.df[Tot.catch.df[,1]==2010,2],0)),big.mark=",")` mt (Table \ref{tab:Comm_Catch}, Figure \ref{fig:Catch}).


##Summary of Management History and Performance
Beginning in 1983 the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) established coast-wide annual catch limits (ACLs) for the annual harvests of `r spp` in the waters off the U.S. West Coast (see, for example, PFMC, 2002). Previous assessments of `r spp` in the U.S.-Vancouver and Columbia INPFC areas have been conducted by Demory (1984), Turnock et al. (1993), Sampson and Lee (1999), and Lai at al. (2005). Based on the 1999 assessment a coast-wide ACL of 2,762 mt was specified and remained unchanged between 2001 and 2006.

The 2005 assessment of `r spp` stock assessment split the stock into two areas, the northern area that included U.S.-Vancouver and Columbia INPFC areas and the southern area that included the Eureka, Monterey and Conception INPFC areas (Lai et al. 2005). While `r spp` stock structure is not well understood, CPUE and geographical differences between states were used to support the use of two separate assessment areas. In 2005 `r spp` were estimated to be at 34 and 29% of unfished spawning stock biomass in the northern and southern areas, respectively. In spite of different models and data, the biomass trends were qualitatively similar in both areas, providing support for a coast-wide stock. Based on the 2005 stock assessment results, ACLs were set at 3025 mt and 2919 mt for 2007 and 2008, respectively, with an ACT of 2499 mt for both years. 

The 2009 coast-wide stock assessment estimated that the `r spp` stock had declined from its 2005 high to 11.6% of the unfished spawning stock biomass, resulting in an overfished declaration for `r spp` and catch restrictions. Recent coast-wide annual landings have not exceeded the ACL (PFMC 2006).

The 2005 stock assessment estimated that `r spp` had been below the Pacific Council's minimum stock size threshold of 25% of unfished biomass from the mid-1970s until just prior to the completion of the assessment, with estimated harvest rates in excess of the target fishing mortality rate implemented for `r spp` at that time (F40%). However, the 2005 stock assessment determined that the stock was in the precautionary zone and was not overfished (i.e., the spawning stock biomass (SB) was not below 25% of the unfished spawning stock biomass (SB0)). In comparison to the 1999 assessment of `r spp`, the 2005 assessment represented a significant change in the perception of `r spp` stock status. The stock assessment conducted in 1999 (Washington-Oregon only) estimated the spawning stock biomass in 1998 at 39% of unfished stock biomass. Although the estimates of 1998 spawning-stock biomass were little changed between the 1999 and 2005 (Northern area) assessments, the estimated depletion in the 2005 assessment was much lower. The change in status between the 1999 and 2005 analyses was due to the introduction of a reconstructed catch history in 2005, which spanned the entire period of removals. The 1999 stock assessment used a catch history that started in 1977, after the bulk of the removals from the fishery had already taken place. Thus the 1999 stock assessment produced a more optimistic view of the petrale stock's level of depletion. The stock's estimated decline in status between the 2005 and 2009 assessments was driven primarily by a significant decline in the trawl-survey index over that period. The 2011 assessment concluded that the stock status continued to be below the target of 25% of unfished biomass.

The fishery for `r spp` (and groundfish in general) has been altered substantially by changes in fishery regulations implemented since 1998. Specifically, in 1996, the PFMC implemented 2-month cumulative vessel landing limits to reduce discards. Beginning in 2000, restrictions were placed on the use of large footropes (more than 8"). Large footrope gear has been prohibited from the waters inside of 275 m (150 fm) following the advent of rockfish conservation areas delineated by depth-based management lines. Although the January and February months of the winter `r spp` fishery have not been subject to vessel landing limits until recently, the 2-month limits restricted `r spp` landings from March through October, and beginning in 2006 during November and February. The areas in which the winter `r spp` fishery has been allowed to operate have also been restricted by actions designed to reduce bycatch of slope rockfish. Effectively, many of the more marginal `r spp` winter fishing grounds were closed while the main fishing areas have remained open. Additionally, industry members indicated that after the 2003 vessel buyback program fishing effort for `r spp` during the winter declined. The skippers also indicated that small petrale limits during 2010 lead to large changes targeting strategies for `r spp`.

Area closures have been used by the PFMC for groundfish management since 2001. Current major area closures are: i) the Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCAs): adopted during 2000 and implemented in 2001; ii) the Yelloweye Rockfish Conservation Areas (YRCAs): the first was adopted during 2002 and implemented in 2003; and iii) the Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs) for several rockfish species: adopted during 2002, implemented as an emergency regulation during fall of 2002 and through regulatory amendment in 2003. Since then, RCAs have been specified continuously for regions north and south of 40o10' N latitude for trawl and fixed-gear groups. The boundaries of the RCAs are delineated by depth-based management lines, and may be changed throughout the year in an effort to achieve fishery management objectives. The area between 180 m and 275 m has been continuously closed to most all bottom groundfish trawling since the implementation of the RCAs.
Vessels with exempted fishing permits (EFPs) issued under 50 CFR part 600 are allowed to operate in some conservation areas. Oregon EFP vessels were allowed to fish in the RCA using more selective 'pineapple'trawl gear (this gear has a longer headrope than footrope, allowing some rockfish a chance to escape capture) from February-October during 2003 and 2004. In pilot experiments, this gear was found to reduce the CPUE of some overfished rockfish and increase CPUE of flatfish relative to standard commercial flatfish gear (King et al. 2004). Beginning in 2005, this modified "selective flatfish" trawl gear has been required shoreward of the RCA, north of $40^\circ10'$ N latitude. The skippers present at the 2011 pre-assessment workshop in Newport, OR indicated that, prior to the use of the pineapple trawl fishing took place around the clock. However, when using the pineapple trawl gear they only fish during the day because the skippers are unable to catch fish at night. The ACLs for several species under rebuilding plans have resulted in limited harvests of other groundfish in recent years.

Port sampling conducted by each state routinely samples market categories to determine the species composition of these mixed-species categories. Since 1967, various port sampling programs have been utilized by state and federal marine fishery agencies to determine the species compositions of the commercial groundfish landings off the U.S. Pacific coast (Sampson and Crone 1997). Current port sampling programs use stratified multi-stage sampling designs to evaluate the species compositions of the total landings in each market category, as well as for obtaining biological data on individual species (Crone 1995, Sampson and Crone 1997).
An IFQ program, referred to as catch shares, was implemented for the trawl fleet beginning in 2011, resulting in changes in fleet behavior and the distribution of fishing effort.


##Fisheries off Canada and Alaska
The Canadian fishery developed rapidly during the late 1940s to mid-1950s following the discovery of `r spp` spawning aggregations off the West Coast of Vancouver Island (Anon. 2001). Annual landings of `r spp` in British Columbia peaked at 4,800 mt in 1948 but declined significantly after the mid-1960s (Anon. 2001). By the 1970s, analysis conducted by Pederson (1975) suggested that petrale abundance was low and abundance remained low into the 1990s. In the early 1990s vessel trip quotas were established to try to halt the decline in `r spp` abundance (Anon. 2001). Winter quarter landings of `r spp` were limited to 44,000 lb per trip during 1985-91; to 10,000 lb per trip during 1991-95; and to 2,000 lb per trip in 1996. Biological data collected during 1980-1996 showed a prolonged decline in the proportion of young fish entering the population (Anon. 2001). Therefore, no directed fishing for `r spp` has been permitted in Canada since 1996 due to a continuing decline in long term abundance (Fargo, 1997, Anon. 2001). Current landings of `r spp` in Canada are very low due to the effect of the non-directed fishery. As of 2005 `r spp` off of British Columbia were treated as three "stocks" and were still considered to be at low levels. The recent assessments for the Canadian stocks have been based on catch histories and limited biological data.

The most recent assessment of `r spp` in British Columbia uses a single area combined sex delay-difference stock assessment model with knife edge recruitment (at 6 or 7 years old) and tuned to fishery CPUE, mean fish weight of the commercial landings, and a number of fishery independent surveys beginning in the early 1980s (P. Starr, pers. comm.). Stock predictions are based on average recruitment (P. Starr, pers. comm.) This assessment suggests that the stock is currently above the target reference point and that there is some evidence for above average recruitment (about 10% above average) since about 1996 (P. Starr, pers. comm.). `r spp.up` in Canadian waters appear to have similar life history characteristics (Starr and Fargo 2004). The Canadian assessment has not been updated since the U.S. `r spp` 2011 assessment.

In Alaska `r spp` are not targeted in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Island fisheries and are managed as a minor species in the "Other Flatfish" stock complex.
