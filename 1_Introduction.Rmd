#Introduction

  
##Basic Information
`r spp.up` (\emph{`r spp.sci`}) is a right-eyed flounder in the family Pleuronectidae ranging from the western Gulf of Alaska to the Coronado Islands, northern Baja California [@kramer_guide_1995; @love_milton_resource_2005] with a preference for soft substrates at depths ranging from 0-550 m [@love_milton_resource_2005]. Common names include brill, California sole, Jordan's flounder, cape sole, round nose sole, English sole, soglia, petorau, nameta, and tsubame garei [@smith_report_1937; @gates_designated_1974; @love_milton_probably_1996; @eschmeyer_field_1983]. In northern and central California `r spp` are dominant on the middle and outer continental shelf. PacFIN fishery logbook data show that adults are caught in depths from 18 to 1,280 m off the U.S. West Coast with a majority of the catches of `r spp` being taken between 70-220 m during March through October, and between 290-440 m during November through February.

Past assessments completed by Demory [-@demory_progress_1984], Turnock et al. [-@turnock_status_1993], and Sampson and Lee [-@sampson_assessment_1999] considered `r spp` in the Columbia and U.S.-Vancouver INPFC areas a single stock. Sampson and Lee (1999) assumed that `r spp` in the Eureka and Monterey INPFC areas represented two additional distinct stocks. The 2005 `r spp` assessment assumed two stocks, northern (U.S.-Vancouver and Columbia INPFC areas) and southern (Eureka, Monterey and Conception INPFC areas), to maintain continuity with previous assessments. Three stocks (West Coast Vancouver Island, Queen Charlotte Sound, and Heceta Strait) are considered for `r spp` in the waters off British Columbia, Canada [@starr_petrale_2004]. The 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015 assessments integrate the previously separate north-south assessments to provide a coast-wide status evaluation. The decision to conduct a single-area assessment is based on strong evidence of a mixed stock from tagging studies, a lack of genetic studies on stock structure, and a lack of evidence for differences in growth between the 2005 northern and southern assessment areas and from examination of the fishery size-at-age data, as well as confounding differences in data collection between Washington, Oregon, and California. This 2019 update assessment provides a coast-wide status evaluation for `r spp` using data through 2018.

Fishing fleets are separated both geographically and seasonally to account for spatial and seasonal patterns in catch given the coast-wide assessment area. The `r spp` fisheries possess a distinct seasonality, with catches peaking during the winter months, so the fisheries are divided into winter (November-February) and summer (March-October) fisheries. Note that the "fishing year" for this assessment (November 1 to October 31 with catches from November and December being added to the subsequent model year) differs from the standard calendar year. The U.S.-Canadian border is the northern boundary for the assessed stock, although the basis for this choice is due to political and current management needs rather than the population dynamics. Given the lack of clear information regarding the status of distinct biological populations, this assessment treats the U.S. `r spp` resource from the Mexican border to the Canadian border as a single coast-wide stock.


##Life History
`r spp.up` spawn during the winter at several discrete deep water sites (270-460 m) off the U.S. West Coast, from November to April, with peak spawning taking place from December to February [@harry_time_1959; @best_petrale_1960; @gregory_validity_1976; @castillo_g.c._environmental_1993; @reilly_recreational_1994; @love_milton_probably_1996]. Females spawn once each year and fecundity varies with fish size, with one large female laying as many as 1.5 million eggs [@porter_notes_1964]. `r spp.up` eggs are planktonic, ranging in size from 1.2 to 1.3 mm, and are found in deep water habitats at water temperatures of 4-10 $^\circ$C and salinities of 25-30 ppt [@best_petrale_1960; @ketchen_population_1966;  @alderdice_effects_1971; @gregory_validity_1976]. The duration of the egg stage can range from approximately 6 to 14 days [@alderdice_effects_1971; @love_milton_probably_1996]. The most favorable conditions for egg incubation and larval growth are 6-7 $^\circ$C and 27.5-29.5 ppt [@ketchen_population_1966; @alderdice_effects_1971; @castillo_latitudinal_1995].

Adult `r spp` achieve a maximum size of around 50 cm and 63 cm for males and females, respectively [@best_e.a._movements_1963; @pedersen_movements_1975]. The maximum length reported for `r spp` is 70 cm [@eschmeyer_field_1983; @love_milton_resource_2005] while the maximum observed break-and-burn age is 34 years (observed in 2003 by the `r nwfsc` survey).


##Ecosystem Considerations
Ecosystem factors have not been explicitly modeled in this assessment, but there are several aspects of the California current ecosystem that may impact `r spp` population dynamics and warrant further research. Castillo [-@castillo_g.c._fluctuations_1992] and Castillo et al. [-@castillo_latitudinal_1995] suggest that density-independent survival of early life stages is low and show that offshore Ekman transportation of eggs and larvae may be an important source of variation in year-class strength in the Columbia INPFC area. The effects of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation on California current temperature and productivity [@mantua_pacific_1997] may also contribute to non-stationary recruitment dynamics for `r spp`. The prevalence of a strong late 1990s year-class for many West Coast groundfish species suggests that environmentally driven recruitment variation may be correlated among species with relatively diverse life history strategies. Although current research efforts along these lines are limited, a more explicit exploration of ecosystem processes may be possible in future `r spp` stock assessments if resources are available for such investigations.


##Historical and Current Fishery Information
`r spp.up` have been caught in the flatfish fishery off the U.S. Pacific coast since the late 19th century. The fishery first developed off of California where, prior to 1876, fishing in San Francisco Bay was by hand or set lines and beach seining [@scofield_trawling_1948]. By 1880 two San Francisco based trawler companies were running a total of six boats, extending the fishing grounds beyond the Golden Gate Bridge northward to Point Reyes [@scofield_trawling_1948]. Steam trawlers entered the fishery during 1888 and 1889, and four steam tugs based out of San Francisco were sufficient to flood market with flatfish [@scofield_trawling_1948]. By 1915 San Francisco and Santa Cruz trawlers were operating at depths of about 45-100 m with catches averaging 10,000 lbs per tow or 3,000 lbs per hour [@scofield_trawling_1948]. Flatfish comprised approximately 90% of the catch with 20-25% being discarded as unmarketable [@scofield_trawling_1948]. During 1915 laws were enacted that prohibited dragging in California waters and making it illegal to possess a trawl net from Santa Barbara County southward [@scofield_trawling_1948]. By 1934 twenty 56-72 foot diesel engine trawlers operated out of San Francisco fishing between about 55 and 185 m [@scofield_trawling_1948]. From 1944-1947 the number of California trawlers fluctuated between 16 and 46 boats [@scofield_trawling_1948]. Although the flatfish fishery in California was well developed by the 1950s and 1960s, catch statistics were not reported until 1970 [@heimann_pacific_1970]. In this early California report `r spp` landings during 1916 to 1930 were not separated from the total flatfish landings. 

The earliest trawl fishing off Oregon began during 1884-1885, and the fishery was solidly established by 1937, with the fishery increasing rapidly during WWII (Harry and Morgan, 1961). Initially trawlers stayed close to the fishing grounds adjacent to Newport and Astoria, operating at about 35-90 m between Stonewall Bank and Depoe Bay. Fishing operations gradually extended into deep water. For example, Newport-based trawlers were commonly fishing at about 185 m in 1949, at about 185-365 m by 1952, and at about 550 m by 1953.

Alverson and Chatwin [-@alverson_results_1957] describe the history of the `r spp` fishery off of Washington and British Columbia with fishing grounds ranging from Cape Flattery to Destruction Island. `r spp.up` catches off of Washington were small until the late 1930s with the fishery extending to about 365 m following the development of deep water rockfish fisheries during the 1950s.

By the 1950s the `r spp` fishery was showing signs of depletion with reports suggesting that `r spp` abundance had declined by at least 50% from 1942 to 1947 [@harry_analysis_1956]. Sampson and Lee [-@sampson_assessment_1999] reported that three fishery regulations were implemented during 1957-67: 1) a winter closure off Oregon, Washington and British Columbia, 2) a 3,000 lb per trip limit, and 3) no more than two trips per month during 1957. With the 1977 enactment of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MFCMA) the large foreign-dominated fishery that had developed since the late 1960s was replaced by the domestic fishery that continues today. `r spp.up` are harvested almost exclusively by bottom trawls in the U.S. West Coast groundfish fishery. Recent `r spp` catches exhibit marked seasonal variation, with substantial portions of the annual harvest taken from the spawning grounds during December and January. Evidence suggests that the winter fishery on the deep water spawning grounds developed sporadically during the 1950s and 1960s as fishers discovered new locations (e.g., @alverson_results_1957; @ketchen_population_1966). Both historical and current `r spp` fisheries have primarily relied upon trawl fleets. 

Historical landings reconstructions show peak catches from the summer fishery occurred during the 1940s and 1950s and subsequently declined, during which time the fleet moved to fishing in deeper waters during the winter. After the period of peak landings during the 1940s and 1950s, total landings were somewhat stable until about the late 1970s, and then generally declined until the mid-2000s. (Table \ref{tab:Comm_Catch} and Figure \ref{fig:Catch}). During 2009 the fishery was declared overfished and during 2010 management restrictions limited the catch to `r prettyNum(as.numeric(round(Tot.catch.df[Tot.catch.df[,1]==2010,2],0)),big.mark=",")` mt (Table \ref{tab:Comm_Catch} and Figure \ref{fig:Catch}). Recent years overfishing limit (OFL), annual catch limit (ACL), landings, and estimated total dead are shown in Table \ref{tab:mnmgt_perform_tables}.


##Summary of Management History and Performance
Beginning in 1983 the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) established coast-wide annual catch limits (ACLs) for the annual harvests of `r spp` in the waters off the U.S. West Coast. The first assessment of West Coast `r spp` occurred in 1984 [@demory_progress_1984]. Based on the 1999 assessment a coast-wide ACL of 2,762 mt was specified and remained unchanged between 2001 and 2006.

The 2005 assessment of `r spp` stock assessment split the stock into two areas, the northern area that included U.S.-Vancouver and Columbia INPFC areas and the southern area that included the Eureka, Monterey and Conception INPFC areas [@lai_stock_2005]. While `r spp` stock structure is not well understood, CPUE and geographical differences between states were used to support the use of two separate assessment areas. In 2005 `r spp` were estimated to be at 34 and 29% of unfished spawning stock biomass in the northern and southern areas, respectively. In spite of different models and data, the biomass trends were qualitatively similar in both areas, providing support for a coast-wide stock. This assessment estimated that `r spp` had historically been below the PFMC's current minimum stock size threshold, 25% of unfished biomass, from the mid-1970s until just prior to the completion of the assessment, with estimated harvest rates in excess of the target fishing mortality rate implemented for `r spp` at that time ($\text{F}_{40\%}$). However, the 2005 stock assessment determined that the stock was in the precautionary zone and was not overfished (i.e., the spawning stock biomass was not below 25% of the unfished spawning stock biomass). Based on the 2005 stock assessment results, ACLs were set at 3,025 mt and 2,919 mt for 2007 and 2008, respectively, with an ACT of 2,499 mt for both years. 

In comparison to the 1999 assessment of `r spp`, the 2005 assessment represented a significant change in the perception of `r spp` stock status. The stock assessment conducted in 1999 (Washington-Oregon only) estimated the spawning stock biomass in 1998 at 39% of unfished stock biomass. Although the estimates of 1998 spawning-stock biomass were little changed between the 1999 and 2005 (Northern area) assessments, the estimated depletion in the 2005 assessment was much lower. The change in status between the 1999 and 2005 analyses was due to the introduction of a reconstructed catch history in 2005, which spanned the entire period of removals. The 1999 stock assessment used a catch history that started in 1977, after the bulk of the removals from the fishery had already taken place. Thus the 1999 stock assessment produced a more optimistic view of the petrale stock's level of depletion. The stock's estimated decline in status between the 2005 and 2009 assessments was driven primarily by a significant decline in the trawl-survey index over that period. The 2011 assessment concluded that the stock status continued to be below the target of 25% of unfished biomass.

The 2009 coast-wide stock assessment estimated that the `r spp` stock at 11.6% of the unfished spawning stock biomass [@haltuch_status_2009]. The `r spp` was declared overfished based on newly adopted management targets (e.g., target spawning biomass for flatfish stocks defined as 25% and overfished threshold of 12.5% of unfished spawning stock biomass) resulting in a rebuilding plan and catch restrictions for `r spp`. The stock was declared rebuilt based on the results of the 2015 update stock assessment which estimated the coastwide biomass at 30.7% of unfished spawning stock output with ACLs of 3,136 and 3,013 in 2017 and 2018 respectively [@stawitz_stock_2015]. 

For additional information on changes in the `r spp` fishery please see the 2013 stock assessment [@haltuch_status_2013].

##Fisheries off Canada and Alaska
The Canadian fishery developed rapidly during the late 1940s to mid-1950s following the discovery of `r spp` spawning aggregations off the West Coast of Vancouver Island [@anon_fish_2001]. Annual landings of `r spp` in British Columbia peaked at 4,800 mt in 1948 but declined significantly after the mid-1960s [@anon_fish_2001]. By the 1970s, analysis conducted by Pederson [-@pedersen_movements_1975] suggested that `r spp` abundance was low and abundance remained low into the 1990s. In the early 1990s vessel trip quotas were established to try to halt the decline in `r spp` abundance [@anon_fish_2001]. Winter quarter landings of `r spp` were limited to 44,000 lb per trip during 1985-91; to 10,000 lb per trip during 1991-95; and to 2,000 lb per trip in 1996. Biological data collected during 1980-1996 showed a prolonged decline in the proportion of young fish entering the population [@anon_fish_2001]. Therefore, no directed fishing for `r spp` has been permitted in Canada since 1996 due to a continuing decline in long term abundance [@fargo_j.j._flatfish_1997; @anon_fish_2001]. As of 2005 `r spp` off of British Columbia were treated as three "stocks" and were still considered to be at low levels. The recent assessments for the Canadian stocks have been based on catch histories and limited biological data. 

In Alaska `r spp` are not targeted in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Island fisheries and are managed as a minor species in the "Other Flatfish" stock complex.
